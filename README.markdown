CartoDB Ruby Client
===================

CartoDB ruby client to allow an straightforward interaction with the CartoDB API.

Requirements
-------------

The only requirement is an Internet connection and a working version of the Ruby language interpreter. Current ruby versions supported are 1.8.7 and 1.9.2

Setup
------

1. Install the client gem:

        gem install cartodb-rb-client

  or if you are using bundler, put this line in your Gemfile:

        gem 'cartodb-rb-client0'

2. Log into http://cartodb.com, get your OAUTH credentials and put them in a YAML file:

  cartodb_config.yml:

        host: 'https://api.cartodb.com'
        oauth_key: 'YOUR_OAUTH_KEY
        oauth_secret: 'YOUR_OAUTH_SECRET'

3. Setup your CartoDB connection object. To do so, load the YAML file and assign it to a CartoDB::Config object:

        CartoDB::Settings = YAML.load_file(Rails.root.join('config/cartodb_config.yml'))
        CartoDB::Connection = CartoDB::Client::Connection.new

And that's it. Now you should be able to run querys against the CartoDB servers using the CartoDB::Connection object.
