        Irrigation Systems of Oman,22.998889,57.536056,\"A qanāt (from Arabic: قناة‎)
        (Iran, Syria and Jordan) is a water management system used to provide a reliable
        supply of water to human settlements and for irrigation in hot, arid and semi-arid
        climates. Qanats are also called kārīz (or kārēz from Persian: كاريز) (Iran,
        Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia, derived from Persian: كاهریز), kahan
        (from Persian: کهن), khettara (Morocco); galeria (Spain); falaj (United Arab
        Emirates and Oman); Kahn (Baloch) or foggara/fughara (North Africa). Alternative
        terms for qanats in Asia and North Africa are kakuriz, chin-avulz, and mayun.
        Common variants of qanat in English include kanat, khanat, kunut, kona, konait,
        ghanat, ghundat.\n\nThe qanat technology is known to have developed in pre-Islamic
        Iran[when?] and then spread to other cultures. However, a recently discovered
        falaj system in al-Ain, UAE, dates to 1000 BC, and another in Umm Safah, Sharja,
        dates to the Iron Age. Also, a qanat-like system called the Turpan water system
        originated in China during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 24 CE).\n\nThe value
        of a qanat is directly related to the quality, volume and regularity of the
        water flow. Much of the population of Iran and other arid countries in Asia
        and North Africa historically depended upon the water from qanats; the areas
        of population corresponded closely to the areas where qanats are possible.
        Although a qanat was expensive to construct, its long-term value to the community,
        and therefore to the group who invested in building and maintaining it, was
        substantial.\n\nQanats are constructed as a series of well-like vertical shafts,
        connected by gently sloping tunnels. Qanats tap into subterranean water in
        a manner that efficiently delivers large quantities of water to the surface
        without need for pumping. The water drains relying on gravity, with the destination
        lower than the source, which is typically an upland aquifer. Qanats allow
        water to be transported over long distances in hot dry climates without losing
        a large proportion of the water to seepage and evaporation.\n\nIt is very
        common in the construction of a qanat for the water source to be found below
        ground at the foot of a range of foothills of mountains, where the water table
        is closest to the surface. From this point, the slope of the qanat is maintained
        closer to level than the surface above, until the water finally flows out
        of the qanat above ground. To reach an aquifer, qanats must often extend for
        long distances.\n\nQanats are sometimes split into an underground distribution
        network of smaller canals called kariz. Like qanats, these smaller canals
        were below ground to avoid contamination. In some cases water from a qanat
        is stored in a reservoir, typically storing night flow for daytime use. An
        Ab Anbar is an example of a traditional qanat fed reservoir for drinking water
        in Persian antiquity.\n\nThe qanat system has the advantage of being resistant
        to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, and to deliberate destruction
        in war. Furthermore, it is almost insensitive to the levels of precipitation,
        delivering a flow with only gradual variations from wet to dry years.\n\nThe
        qanat technology is used most extensively in areas with the following characteristics:[citation
        needed]\n\nA typical town or city in Iran and elsewhere where the qanat is
        used has more than one qanat. Fields and gardens are located both over the
        qanats a short distance before they emerge from the ground and after the surface
        outlet. Water from the qanats defines both the social regions in the city
        and the layout of the city.\n\nThe water is freshest, cleanest, and coolest
        in the upper reaches and more prosperous people live at the outlet or immediately
        upstream of the outlet. When the qanat is still below grade, the water is
        drawn to the surface via water wells or animal driven Persian wells. Private
        subterranean reservoirs could supply houses and buildings for domestic use
        and garden irrigation as well. Further, air flow from the qanat is used to
        cool an underground summer room (shabestan) found in many older houses and
        buildings.\n\nDownstream of the outlet, the water runs through surface canals
        called jubs (jūbs) which run downhill, with lateral branches to carry water
        to the neighborhood, gardens and fields. The streets normally parallel the
        jubs and their lateral branches. As a result, the cities and towns are oriented
        consistent with the gradient of the land; this is a practical response to
        efficient water distribution over varying terrain.\n\nThe lower reaches of
        the canals are less desirable for both residences and agriculture. The water
        grows progressively more polluted as it passes downstream. In dry years the
        lower reaches are the most likely to see substantial reductions in flow.\n\nTraditionally
        qanats are built by a group of skilled laborers, muqannīs, with hand labor.
        The profession historically paid well and was typically handed down from father
        to son.\n\nThe critical, initial step in qanat construction is identification
        of an appropriate water source. The search begins at the point where the alluvial
        fan meets the mountains or foothills; water is more abundant in the mountains
        because of orographic lifting and excavation in the alluvial fan is relatively
        easy. The muqannīs follow the track of the main water courses coming from
        the mountains or foothills to identify evidence of subsurface water such as
        deep-rooted vegetation or seasonal seeps. A trial well is then dug to determine
        the location of the water table and determine whether a sufficient flow is
        available to justify construction. If these prerequisites are met, then the
        route is laid out aboveground.\n\nEquipment must be assembled. The equipment
        is straightforward: containers (usually leather bags), ropes, reels to raise
        the container to the surface at the shaft head, hatchets and shovels for excavation,
        lights, spirit levels or plumb bobs and string. Depending upon the soil type,
        qanat liners (usually fired clay hoops) may also be required.\n\nAlthough
        the construction methods are simple, the construction of a qanat requires
        a detailed understanding of subterranean geology and a degree of engineering
        sophistication. The gradient of the qanat must be carefully controlled—too
        shallow a gradient yields no flow—too steep a gradient will result in excessive
        erosion, collapsing the qanat. And misreading the soil conditions leads to
        collapses which at best require extensive rework and, at worst, can be fatal
        for the crew.\n\nConstruction of a qanat is usually performed by a crew of
        3-4 muqannīs. For a shallow qanat, one worker typically digs the horizontal
        shaft, one raises the excavated earth from the shaft and one distributes the
        excavated earth at the top.\n\nThe crew typically begins from the destination
        to which the water will be delivered into the soil and works toward the source
        (the test well). Vertical shafts are excavated along the route, separated
        at a distance of 20–35 m. The separation of the shafts is a balance between
        the amount of work required to excavate them and the amount of effort required
        to excavate the space between them, as well as the ultimate maintenance effort.
        In general, the shallower the qanat, the closer the vertical shafts. If the
        qanat is long, excavation may begin from both ends at once. Tributary channels
        are sometimes also constructed to supplement the water flow.\n\nMost qanats
        in Iran run less than 5 km, while some have been measured at ~70 km in length
        near Kerman. The vertical shafts usually range from 20 to 200 meters in depth,
        although qanats in the province of Khorasan have been recorded with vertical
        shafts of up to 275 m. The vertical shafts support construction and maintenance
        of the underground channel as well as air interchange. Deep shafts require
        intermediate platforms to simplify the process of removing spoils.\n\nThe
        construction speed depends on the depth and nature of the ground. If the earth
        is easy/soft to work; at 20 meters depth, a crew of 4 people can excavate
        a horizontal length of 40 meters per day. When the vertical shaft reaches
        40 meters, they can only excavate 20 meters horizontally per day and at 60
        meters in depth this drops below 5 horizontal meters per day. In Algeria,
        a common speed is just 2m per day at 15m depth. Deep, long qanats (which many
        are) require years and even decades to construct.\n\nThe excavated material
        is usually transported by means of leather bags up the vertical shafts. It
        is mounded around the vertical shaft exit, providing a barrier that prevents
        windblown or rain driven debris from entering the shafts. These mounds may
        be covered to provide further protection to the qanat. From the air, these
        shafts look like a string of bomb craters.\n\nThe qanat's water-carrying channel
        must have a sufficient downward slope that water flows easily. However the
        downward gradient must not be so great as to create conditions under which
        the water transitions between supercritical and subcritical flow; if this
        occurs, the waves which are established can result in severe erosion that
        can damage or destroy the qanat. In shorter qanats the downward gradient varies
        between 1:1000 and 1:1500, while in longer qanats it may be almost horizontal.
        Such precision is routinely obtained with a spirit level and string.\n\nIn
        cases where the gradient is steeper, underground waterfalls may be constructed
        with appropriate design features (usually linings) to absorb the energy with
        minimal erosion. In some cases the water power has been harnessed to drive
        underground mills. If it is not possible to bring the outlet of the qanat
        out near the settlement, it is necessary to run a jub or canal overground.
        This is avoided when possible to limit pollution, warming and water loss due
        to evaporation.\n\nThe vertical shafts may be covered to minimize in-blown
        sand. The channels of qanats must be periodically inspected for erosion or
        cave-ins, cleaned of sand and mud and otherwise repaired. Air flow must be
        assured before entry for safety.\n\nSome damaged qanats have been restored.
        In order to be sustainable, restoration needs to take into account many non-technical
        factors, beginning with the process of selecting the qanat to be restored.
        In the case of Syria, three sites were chosen based on a national inventory
        conducted in 2001. One of them, the Drasiah qanat of Dmeir, was completed
        in 2002. Selection criteria included the availability of a steady groundwater
        flow, social cohesion and willingness to contribute of the community using
        the qanat, and the existence of a functioning water rights system.\n\nThe
        primary applications of qanats are for irrigation, providing cattle with water
        and drinking water supply. Other applications include cooling and ice storage.\n\nQanats
        used in conjunction with a wind tower can provide cooling as well as a water
        supply. A wind tower is a chimney-like structure positioned above the house;
        of its four openings, the one opposite the wind direction is opened to move
        air out of the house. Incoming air is pulled from a qanat below the house.
        The air flow across the vertical shaft opening creates a lower pressure (see
        Bernoulli effect) and draws cool air up from the qanat tunnel, mixing with
        it. The air from the qanat was drawn into the tunnel at some distance away
        and is cooled both by contact with the cool tunnel walls/water and by the
        giving up latent heat of evaporation as water evaporates into the air stream.
        In dry desert climates this can result in a greater than 15°C reduction in
        the air temperature coming from the qanat; the mixed air still feels dry,
        so the basement is cool and only comfortably moist (not damp). Wind tower
        and qanat cooling have been used in desert climates for over 1000 years.\n\nIn
        400 BC Persian engineers had already mastered the technique of storing ice
        in the middle of summer in the desert.\n\nThe ice could be brought in during
        the winters from nearby mountains. But in a more usual & sophisticated method
        they had a wall made along east-west direction close to the Ice Pit (yakhchal).In
        winter the qanat water was being canalized to north side of the wall. The
        shadow of the wall makes water freeze more quickly so they could have more
        ice per each winter day. Then ice was being stored in a specially designed,
        naturally cooled refrigerators called yakhchal (meaning ice pits). A large
        underground space with thick insulated walls was connected to a qanat, and
        a system of windcatchers or Wind Towers was used to draw cool subterranean
        air up from the qanat to maintain temperatures inside the space at low levels,
        even during hot summer days. As a result, the ice melted slowly and ice was
        available year-round.\n\nThe Qanats, called Kariz (rhymes with \"\"breeze\"\")
        \ in Pashto and Dari, have also been in use for hundreds of years. Kariz structures
        are especially found in the Southern Afghanistan provinces of Kandahar, Uruzgan,
        Nimroz and Hilmand. The incessant war for the last 30 years has destroyed
        a number of these ancient structures. In the troubled times maintenance was
        not always possible. To add to the troubles, at present (2008) the cost of
        labour has become very high and maintaining the Kariz structures is no longer
        possible[dubious – discuss]. Lack of skilled artisans who have the traditional
        knowledge also poses difficulties. A number of the large farmers are abandoning
        their Kariz which has been in their families sometimes for centuries, and
        moving to tube and dug wells backed by diesel pumps[citation needed].\n\nHowever
        the government of Afghanistan is aware of the importance of these structures
        and all efforts are being made to repair, reconstruct and maintain (through
        the community) the kariz[citation needed]. The Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation
        and Development along with National and International NGOs is making the effort.\n\nStill,
        there are functional qanat systems in 2009. American forces are reported to
        have unintentionally destroyed some of the channels during expansion of a
        military base, creating tensions between them and the local community. Some
        of these tunnels have been used to store supplies, and to move men and equipment
        underground.\n\nAn oasis at Turpan in the deserts of northwestern China uses
        water provided by qanat (locally karez). Turfan has long been the center of
        a fertile oasis and an important trade center along the Silk Road's northern
        route, at which time it was adjacent to the kingdoms of Korla and Karashahr
        to the southwest. The historical record of the karez system extends back to
        the Han Dynasty. The Turfan Water Museum (see photos on this page) is a Protected
        Area of the People's Republic of China because of the importance of the local
        karez system to the history of the area. The number of karez systems in the
        area is slightly below 1,000 and the total length of the canals is about 5,000
        kilometers.\n\nIn Karnataka, India, a Qanat-type structure called Suranga
        is used to tap underground water. But these are rarely in use these days[citation
        needed].\n\nIt has been suggested that alleged underground temples at Gua
        Made in Java reached by shafts, in which masks of a green metal were found,
        originated as a qanat.\n\nIn the middle of the twentieth century, it is estimated
        that approximately 50,000 qanats were in use in Iran, each commissioned and
        maintained by local users. Of these only 25,000 remain in use as of 1980.\n\nThe
        oldest and largest known qanat is in the Iranian city of Gonabad which after
        2700 years still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000
        people. Its main well depth is more than 360 meters and its length is 45 kilometers.
        Yazd, Khorasan and Kerman are the known zones for their dependence with an
        extensive system of qanats.\n\nIn traditional Persian architecture, a Kariz
        (کاریز) is a small Qanat, usually within a network inside an urban setting.
        Kariz is what distributes the Qanat into its final destinations.\n\nA survey
        of Qanat systems in the Kurdistan region of Iraq conducted by the Department
        of Geography at Oklahoma State University (USA) on behalf of UNESCO in 2009
        found that out of 683 karez systems, some 380 were still active in 2004, but
        only 116 in 2009. Reasons for the decline of qanats include \"\"abandonment
        and neglect\"\" previous to 2004, \"\"excessive pumping from wells\"\" and,
        since 2005, drought. Water shortages are said to have forced over 100,000
        people who depended on karez systems for their livelihoods to leave their
        homes since 2005. The study says that a single karez has the potential to
        provide enough household water for nearly 9,000 individuals and irrigate over
        200 hectares of farmland. UNESCO and the government of Iraq plan to rehabilitate
        Karez through a Karez Initiative for Community Revitalization to be launched
        in 2010. Most of the karez are in Sulaymaniyah Governorate (84%). A large
        number are also found in Erbil Governorate (13%), especially on the broad
        plain around and in Erbil city.\n\nAmong the qanats built in the Roman Empire
        was possibly the longest continuous qanat ever built, the 94 km long Gadara
        Aqueduct in northern Jordan. Partly following the course of an older Hellenistic
        aqueduct, excavation work arguably started after a visit of emperor Hadrian
        in 129-130 AD. The Gadara Aqueduct was never quite finished, and was put in
        service only in sections.\n\nThe Chagai district is in the north west corner
        of Balochistan, Pakistan, bordering with Afghanistan and Iran. Qanats, locally
        known as karezes, are found more broadly in this region. They are spread from
        Chaghai district all the way up to Zhob district. A number of them are present
        in Qilla Abdullah and Pishin districts. Karezes are also extensively found
        in the neighbouring areas of Afghanistan such as Kandahar. The remains of
        karezes found in different parts of the district are attributed to the Arabs.\n\nQanats
        were found over much of Syria. The widespread installation of groundwater
        pumps has lowered the water table and qanat system. Qanats have gone dry and
        been abandoned across the country.\n\nIn Oman from the Iron Age Period (found
        in Salut, Bat and other sites) a system of underground aqueducts called Falaj
        were constructed, a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by gently
        sloping horizontal tunnels. There are three types of Falaj Daudi (داوودية)with
        underground aqueducts Ghaili (الغيلية ) requiring a dam to collect the water
        Aini (العينية ) whose source is a water spring These enabled large scale agriculture
        to flourish in a dry land environment According to UNESCO some 3,000 aflaj
        (plural) or falaj (singular), are still in use in Oman today. Nizwa, the former
        capital city of Oman, was built around a falaj which is in use to this day.
        These systems date to before the Iron Age in Oman . In July 2006, five representative
        examples of this irrigation system were inscribed as a World Heritage Site.\n\nThe
        oasis of Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates continues traditional falaj (qanat)
        irrigations for the palm-groves and gardens.\n\nThere are 4 main oases in
        the Egyptian desert. The Kharga Oasis is one of them which has been extensively
        studied. As early as the second half of the 5th century BC there is evidence
        that water was being used via qanats. The qanat is excavated through water-bearing
        sandstone rock which seeps into the channel to collect in a basin behind a
        small dam at the end. The width is approximately 60 cm, but the height ranges
        from 5 to 9 meters; it is likely that the qanat was deepened to enhance seepage
        when the water table dropped (as is also seen in Iran). From there the water
        was used to irrigate fields.\n\nThere is another instructive structure located
        at the Kharga Oasis. A well which apparently dried up was improved by driving
        a side shaft through the easily penetrated sandstone (presumably in the direction
        of greatest water seepage) into the hill of Ayn-Manâwîr to allow collection
        of additional water. After this side shaft had been extended, another vertical
        shaft was driven to intersect the side shaft. Side chambers were built and
        holes bored into the rock—presumably at points where water seeped from the
        rocks—are evident.\n\nDavid Mattingley reports foggara extending for hundreds
        of miles in the Garamantes area near Jarma in Libya: \"\"The channels were
        generally very narrow - less than 2 feet wide and 5 high - but some were several
        miles long, and in total some 600 foggara extended for hundreds of miles underground.
        The channels were dug out and maintained using a series of regularly-spaced
        vertical shafts, one every 30 feet or so, 100,000 in total, averaging 30 feet
        in depth, but sometimes reaching 130.\"\" (\"\"The 153 Club Newsletter\"\",
        July 2007 No. 112, pp. 14–19; reprinted from Current world Archaeology.\n\nThe
        foggara water management system in Tunisia, used to create oases, is similar
        to that of the Iranian qanat. The foggara is dug into the foothills of a fairly
        steep mountain range such as the eastern ranges of the Atlas mountains. Rainfall
        in the mountains enters the aquifer and moves toward the Saharan region to
        the south. The foggara, 1 to 3 km in length, penetrates the aquifer and collects
        water. Families maintain the foggara and own the land it irrigates over a
        ten meter wide, with width only by the size of plot that the available water
        will irrigate.\n\nQanats (designated foggaras in Algeria) are the source of
        water for irrigation at large oases like that at Gourara. The foggaras are
        also found at Touat (an area of Adrar 200 km from Gourara). The length of
        the foggaras in this region is estimated to be thousands of kilometers.\n\nAlthough
        sources suggest that the foggaras may have been in use as early as 200 AD,
        they were clearly in use by the 11th century after the Arabs took possession
        of the oases in the 10th century and the residents embraced Islam.\n\nThe
        water is metered to the various users through the use of distribution weirs
        which meter flow to the various canals, each for a separate user.\n\nThe humidity
        of the oases is also used to supplement the water supply to the foggara. The
        temperature gradient in the vertical shafts causes air to rise by natural
        convection, causing a draft to enter the foggara. The moist air of the agricultural
        area is drawn into the foggara in the opposite direction to the water run-off.
        In the foggara it condenses on the tunnel walls and the air passed out of
        the vertical shafts. This condensed moisture is available for reuse.\n\nIn
        southern Morocco the qanat (locally khettara) is also used. On the margins
        of the Sahara Desert, the isolated oases of the Draa River valley and Tafilalt
        have relied on qanat water for irrigation since the late-14th century. In
        Marrakech and the Haouz plain the qanats have been abandoned since the early
        1970s as they've dried; in the Tafilaft area half of the 400 khettaras are
        still in use. The Hassan Adahkil Dam's impact on local water tables is said
        to be one of the many reasons given for the loss of half of the khettara.\n\nThe
        black berbers (haratin) of the south were the hereditary class of qanat diggers
        in Morocco who build and repair these systems. Their work was hazardous.\n\nQanats
        have preserved in Armenia in the community of Shvanidzor, in the southern
        province of Syunik, bordering with Iran. Qanats are named kahrezes in Armenian.
        There are 5 kahrezes in Shvanidzor. Four of them were constructed in XII-XIVc,
        even before the village was founded. The fifth kahrez was constructed in 2005.
        Potable water runs through I, II and V kahrezs. Kahrez III and IV are in quite
        poor condition. In summer, especially in July and August, the amount of water
        reaches its minimum, creating critical situation in the water supply system.
        Still, kahrezes are the main source of potable and irrigation water for the
        community.\n\nThe 5653 m long Claudius Tunnel, meant for draining the largest
        Italian inland water, Fucine Lake, was constructed using the qanat technique.
        It featured shafts up to 122 m deep. The entire ancient town of Palermo in
        Sicily was equipped with a huge qanat system built during the Arab period
        (827–1072). Many of the qanat are now mapped and some can be visited. The
        famous Scirocco room has an air-conditioning system cooled by the flow of
        water in a qanat and a \"\"wind tower\"\", a structure able to catch the wind
        and direct it into the room.\n\nThe Raschpëtzer near Helmsange in southern
        Luxembourg is a particularly well preserved example of a Roman qanat. It is
        probably the most extensive system of its kind north of the Alps. To date
        some 330 m of the total tunnel length of 600 m have been explored. Thirteen
        of the 20 to 25 shafts have been investigated. The qanat appears to have provided
        water for a large Roman villa on the slopes of the Alzette valley. It was
        built during the Gallo-Roman period, probably around the year 150 and functioned
        for about 120 years thereafter.\n\nThere are still many examples of galeria
        or qanat systems in Spain, most likely brought to the area by the Moors during
        their occupation of the Iberian peninsula. Turrillas in Andalusia on the north
        facing slopes of the Sierra de Alhamilla has evidence of a qanat system. Granada
        is another site with an extensive qanat system.\n\nQanats in the Americas,
        usually referred to as filtration galleries, can be found in the Nazca region
        of Peru and in northern Chile. The Spanish introduced qanats into Mexico in
        1520 AD.\",\"Dakhiliya, Sharqiya and Batinah Regions\",cultural,,\"Dakhiliya,

        Cathedral,49.895,2.301667,\"The Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens (French: Cathédrale
        Notre-Dame d'Amiens), or simply Amiens Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic cathedral
        and seat of the Bishop of Amiens, Jean-Luc Bouilleret. The cathedral is the
        tallest complete cathedral in France, with the greatest interior volume (estimated
        at 200,000 m³). The vaults of the nave are 42.30 m high, the tallest nave
        vaults in any completed French cathedral, and surpassed only by the incomplete
        Beauvais Cathedral. This monumental cathedral is located in Amiens, the chief
        city of Picardy, in the Somme River valley a little over 100 kilometers north
        of Paris.\n\nNotre-Dame d'Amiens has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage
        Site since 1981 and was profiled in a PBS documentary.\n\nThe lack of documentation
        concerning the construction of the Gothic cathedral may be in part the result
        of fires that destroyed the chapter archives in 1218 and again in 1258—a fire
        that damaged the cathedral itself. Bishop Evrard de Fouilly initiated work
        on the cathedral in 1220. Robert de Luzarches was the architect until 1228,
        and was followed by Thomas de Cormont until 1258. His son, Renaud de Cormont,
        acted as the architect until 1288. The chronicle of Corbie gives a completion
        date for the cathedral of 1266. Finishing works continued, however. Its floors
        are covered with a number of designs, such as the swastika (to symbolize Jesus'
        triumph over death). The labyrinth was installed in 1288. The cathedral contains
        the alleged head of John the Baptist, a relic brought from Constantinople
        by Wallon de Sarton as he was returning from the Fourth Crusade.\n\nThe construction
        of the cathedral at this period can be seen as resulting from a coming together
        of necessity and opportunity. The destruction of earlier buildings and attempts
        at rebuilding by fire forced the fairly rapid construction of a building that,
        consequently, has a good deal of artistic unity. The long and relatively peaceful
        reign of Louis IX of France brought a prosperity to the region, based on thriving
        agriculture and a booming cloth trade, that made the investment possible.
        The great cathedrals of Reims and Chartres are roughly contemporary.\n\nThe
        original design of the flying buttresses around the choir had them placed
        too high to counteract the force of the ceiling arch pushing outwards resulting
        in excessive lateral forces being placed on the vertical columns. The structure
        was only saved when, centuries later, masons placed a second row of more robust
        flying buttresses that connected lower down on the outer wall. This fix failed
        to counteract similar issues with the lower wall which began to develop large
        cracks around the late Middle Ages. This was solved by another patch that
        consisted of a wrought iron bar chain being installed around the mezzanine
        level to resist the forces pushing the stone columns outward. The chain was
        installed red hot to act as a cinch, tightening as it cooled.\n\nThe west
        front of the cathedral, (illustration, right) built in a single campaign,
        1220–36, shows an unusual degree of artistic unity: its lower tier with three
        vast deep porches is capped with the gallery of twenty-two over lifesize kings,
        which stretches across the entire façade beneath the rose window. Above the
        rose window there is an open arcade, the galerie des sonneurs. Flanking the
        nave, the two towers were built without close regard to the former design,
        the south tower being finished in 1366, the north one, reaching higher, in
        1406.\n\nThe Western portals of the cathedral are justly famous for their
        elaborate sculpture, featuring a gallery of locally-important saints and large
        eschatological scenes. Statues of saints in the portal of the cathedral have
        been identified as including the locally venerated Saints Victoricus and Gentian,
        Saint Domitius, Saint Ulphia, and Saint Fermin.\n\nIn the book Mr Standfast,
        John Buchan has his character Richard Hannay describe the cathedral as being
        \"\"the noblest church that the hand of man ever built only for God.\"\"\n\nDuring
        the process of laser cleaning in the 1990s, it was discovered that the western
        façade of the cathedral was originally painted in multiple colours. A technique
        was perfected to determine the exact make-up of the colours as they were applied
        in the 13th century. Then, in conjunction with the laboratories of EDF (Electricity
        of France) and the expertise of the Society Skertzo, elaborate lighting techniques
        were developed to project these colours directly on the façade with precision,
        recreating the polychromatic appearance of the 13th century. When projected
        on the statues around the portals, the result is a stunning display that brings
        the figures to life. The projected colors are faint to photograph, but a good
        quality DSLR will provide excellent results as shown here.\n\nOf course, the
        full magical effect can best be appreciated by direct viewing, accompanied
        by stirring music, which can be done at the Son et lumière on Summer evenings,
        during the Christmas Fair, and over the New Year.\n\nAmiens cathedral contains
        the largest medieval interior in Western Europe, supported by 126 pillars.
        Both the nave and the chancel are vast but extremely light, with considerable
        amounts of stained glass surviving, despite the depredations of war.\n\nThe
        ambulatory surrounding the choir is richly decorated with polychrome sculpture
        and flanked by numerous chapels. One of the most sumptuous is the Drapers'
        chapel. The cloth industry was the most dynamic component of the medieval
        economy, especially in northern France, and the cloth merchants were keen
        to display their wealth and civic pride. Another striking chapel is dedicated
        to St Thomas of Canterbury, a 13th century dedication that complements the
        cathedral's own very full list of martyrs.\n\nThe interior contains works
        of art and decoration from every period since the building of the cathedral.\n\nThe
        initial impetus for the building of the cathedral came from the installation
        of the reputed head of John the Baptist on 17 December 1206. The head was
        part of the loot of the Fourth Crusade, which had been diverted from campaigning
        against the Turks to sacking the great Christian city of Constantinople. A
        sumptuous reliquary was made to house the skull. Although later lost, a 19th
        century replica still provides a focus for prayer and meditation in the North
        aisle.\n\nSome of the most important works of art are sequences of polychrome
        sculpture, dating mainly from the late 15th and the 16th centuries. A large
        sequence in the North transept illustrates Jesus' Cleansing of the Temple,
        with imaginative tableaux of the Temple. Both sides of the ambulatory are
        lined with sequences illustrating the lives of the two saints whose cults
        brought large numbers of pilgrims to the cathedral: John the Baptist and St
        Firmin, the first bishop of Amiens. The artists took care to create a parallelism
        in the telling of the stories: both saints, decapitated for offending the
        rich and powerful, suffer neglect and loss, until a later generation discovers
        their relics and houses them fittingly.\n\nThe baroque pulpit, constructed
        of marble and gilded wood, dominates the nave of the cathedral. It is supported
        by three allegorical female figures, apparently representing Faith, Hope and
        Charity, the three Theological Virtues.\n\n\n\nCoordinates: 49°53′42″N 2°18′08″E\uFEFF

        of Bosra,32.51806,36.48167,\"Bosra (Arabic: بصرى‎, also Bostra, Busrana, Bozrah,
        Bozra, Busra Eski Şam, Busra ash-Sham, Nova Trajana Bostra) is an ancient
        city administratively belonging to the Daraa Governorate in southern Syria.
        It is a major archaeological site and has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage
        Site.\n\nThe settlement was first mentioned in the documents of Tutmose III
        and Akhenaton (14th century BC). Bosra was the first Nabatean city in the
        2nd century BC. The Nabatean Kingdom was conquered by Cornelius Palma, a general
        of Trajan, in 106.\n\nUnder the Roman Empire, Bosra was renamed Nova Trajana
        Bostra, and was the residence of the legio III Cyrenaica and capital of the
        Roman province Arabia Petraea. The city flourished and became a major metropolis
        at the juncture of several trade routes, including the Roman road to the Red
        Sea. The two Councils of Arabia were held at Bostra in 246 and 247 AD. The
        city was conquered by the Sassanid Persians in the early 7th century, and,
        after a short Byzantine reconquest, was finally captured by the forces of
        the Rashidun Caliphate under Khalid ibn Walid in the Battle of Bosra (634).
        Thereafter it was an Islamic possession.\n\nBosra played an important part
        in the early life of the Prophet of Islam, Mohammed as described in the entry
        for the Christian Monk, Bahira. Bahira was witnessing to Muhammad in the prophethood.\n\nToday,
        Bosra is a major archaeological site, containing ruins from Roman, Byzantine,
        and Muslim times, its main feature being the well preserved Roman theatre.
        Every year there is a national music festival hosted in the main theater.\n\nOf
        the city which once counted 80,000 inhabitants, there remains today only a
        village settled among the ruins. The second century Roman theater, constructed
        probably under Trajan, is the only monument of this type with its upper gallery
        in the form of a covered portico which has been integrally preserved. It was
        fortified between 481 and 1231 AD.\n\nFurther, Nabatean and Roman monuments,
        Christian churches, mosques and Madrasahs are present within the half ruined
        enceinte of the city. The structure of this monument a central plan with eastern
        apses flanked by 2 sacristies exerted a decisive influence on the evolution
        of Christian architectural forms, and, to a certain extent, on Islamic style
        as well. Al-Omari Mosque of Bosra is one of the oldest surviving mosques in
        Islamic history.\n\nClose by are the Kharaba Bridge and the Gemarrin Bridge,
        both Roman bridges.\n\nCoordinates: 32°31′N 36°29′E\uFEFF / \uFEFF32.517°N

        [neˈsebər], also transcribed as Nessebar or Nesebur; ancient name: Mesembria)
        is an ancient town and one of the major seaside resorts on the Bulgarian Black
        Sea Coast, located in Burgas Province. It is the administrative centre of
        the homonymous Nesebar Municipality. Often referred to as the \"\"Pearl of
        the Black Sea\"\" and \"\"Bulgaria's Dubrovnik\"\", Nesebar is a rich city-museum
        defined by more than three millennia of ever-changing history.\n\nIt is a
        one of the most prominent tourist destinations and seaports on the Black Sea,
        in what has become a popular area with several large resorts—the largest,
        Sunny Beach, is situated immediately to the north of Nesebar.\n\nNesebar has
        on several occasions found itself on the frontier of a threatened empire,
        and as such it is a town with a rich history. The ancient part of the town
        is situated on a peninsula (previously an island) connected to the mainland
        by a narrow man-made isthmus, and it bears evidence of occupation by a variety
        of different civilisations over the course of its existence. Its abundance
        of historic buildings prompted UNESCO to include Nesebar in its list of World
        Heritage Sites in 1983.\n\nAs of December 2009, the town has a population
        of 11,626 inhabitants. It lies at 42°39′N 27°44′E\uFEFF / \uFEFF42.65°N 27.733°E\uFEFF

        / 42.65; 27.733.\n\nInhabited in the Antiquity by the Thracians and the Ancient
        Greeks, the original Thracian settlement Menebria was called Mesembria (Ancient Greek:
        Μεσήμβρια) by the Ancient Greeks. Under this name it was still known in the
        Middle Ages to Bulgarians and Byzantines.\n\nOriginally a Thracian settlement
        known as Menebria, the town became a Greek colony when settled by Dorians
        from Megara at the beginning of the 6th century BC, and was an important trading
        centre from then on and a rival of Apollonia (Sozopol). It remained the only
        Doric colony along the Black Sea coast, as the rest were typical Ionic colonies.
        Remains from the Hellenistic period include the acropolis, a temple of Apollo,
        and an agora. A wall which formed part of the fortifications can still be
        seen on the north side of the peninsula. Bronze and silver coins were minted
        in the city since the 5th century BC and gold coins since the 3rd century
        BC.\n\nThe town fell under Roman rule in 71 BC, yet continued to enjoy privileges
        such as the right to mint its own coinage. It was one of the most important
        strongholds of the Byzantine Empire from the 5th century AD onwards, and was
        fought over by Byzantines and Bulgarians, being captured and incorporated
        in the lands of the First Bulgarian Empire in 812 by Khan Krum after a two
        week siege only to be ceded back to Byzantium by Knyaz Boris I in 864 and
        reconquered by his son Tsar Simeon the Great. During the time of the Second
        Bulgarian Empire it was also contested by Bulgarian and Byzantine forces and
        enjoyed particular prosperity under Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander (1331–1371)
        until it was conquered by Crusaders led by Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in 1366.
        The Bulgarian version of the name, Nesebar or Mesebar, has been attested since
        the 11th century.\n\nMonuments from the Middle Ages include the 5–6th century
        Stara Mitropoliya (\"\"old bishopric\"\"; also St Sophia), a basilica without
        a transept; the 10th century church of the Virgin; and the 11th century Nova
        Mitropoliya (\"\"new bishopric\"\"; also St Stephen) which continued to be
        embellished until the 18th century. In the 13th and 14th century a remarkable
        series of churches were built: St Theodore, St Paraskeva, St Michael St Gabriel,
        and St John Aliturgetos.\n\nThe capture of the town by the Turks in 1453 marked
        the start of its decline, but its architectural heritage remained and was
        enriched in the 19th century by the construction of wooden houses in style
        typical for the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast during this period. It was a kaza
        centre in İslimye sanjak of Edirne Province before 1878. After the Liberation
        of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in 1878, Nesebar became part of the autonomous
        Ottoman province of Eastern Rumelia as a kaza centre in Burgaz sanjak until
        it united with the Principality of Bulgaria in 1886.\n\nAround the end of
        the 19th century Nesebar was a small town of Greek fishermen and vinegrowers,
        but developed as a key Bulgarian seaside resort since the beginning of the
        20th century. After 1925 a new town part was built and the historic Old Town
        was restored.\n\nNesebar is sometimes said to be the town with the highest
        number of churches per capita.[1], [2] Although this might be wrong, their
        number and variety is still impressive. Some of the most famous include:\n\nWhether
        built during the Byzantine, Bulgarian or Ottoman rule of the city, the churches
        of Nesebar represent the rich architectural heritage of the Eastern Orthodox
        world and illustrate the gradual development from Early Christian basilicas
        to medieval cross-domed churches.\n\nNesebar Gap on Livingston Island in the
        South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Nesebar.\",Burgas Province,cultural,,Burgas

        Thebes with its Necropolis,25.73333,32.6,\"Thebes (Θῆβαι, Thēbai, Arabic:
        طيبة‎, Ṭībah) is the Greek name for a city in Ancient Egypt located about
        800 km south of the Mediterranean, on the east bank of the river Nile. The
        Theban Necropolis is located nearby on the west bank of the Nile. Thebes was
        inhabited from around 3200 BC. It was the eponymous capital of Waset, the
        fourth Upper Egyptian nome. Waset was the capital of Egypt during part of
        the 11th Dynasty (Middle Kingdom) and most of the 18th Dynasty (New Kingdom),
        when Hatshepsut built a Red Sea fleet to facilitate trade between Thebes Red
        Sea port of Elim, modern Quasir, and Elat at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba.
        Traders bought frankincense, myrrh, bitumen, natron, fine woven linen, juniper
        oil and copper amulets for the mortuary industry at Karnak with Nubian gold.
        With the 19th Dynasty the seat of government moved to the Delta. The archaeological
        remains of Thebes offer a striking testimony to Egyptian civilization at its
        height. The Greek poet Homer extolled the wealth of Thebes in the Iliad, Book
        9 (c. 8th Century BC): \"\"... in Egyptian Thebes the heaps of precious ingots
        gleam, the hundred-gated Thebes.\"\"\n\nThe name Thebai is the Greek designation
        of the ancient Egyptian opet \"\"The Karnak Temple\"\" (from coptic ta-pe,
        Ta-opet became Thebai). At the seat of the Theban triad of Amun, Mut, and
        Khonsu, Thebes was known in the Egyptian language from the end of the New
        Kingdom as niwt-imn, \"\"The City of Amun.\"\" This found its way into the
        Hebrew Bible as נא אמון nōʼ ʼāmôn (Nahum 3:8),\"\"no\"\" in Hebrew meaning
        city with \"\"no amon\"\" or \"\"City of Amon\"\" referring to the Egyptian
        deity Amon-Ra, most likely it is also the same as נא (\"\"No\"\") (Ezekiel
        30:14). In Greek this name was rendered Διόσπολις Diospolis, \"\"City of Zeus\"\",
        as Zeus was the god whom the Greeks identified with Amun, see interpretatio
        graeca. The Greeks surnamed the city μεγάλη megale, \"\"the Great\"\", to
        differentiate it from numerous other cities called Diospolis. The Romans rendered
        the name Diospolis Magna.\n\nIn modern usage, the mortuary temples and tombs
        on the west bank of the river Nile are generally thought of as part of Thebes.\n\nIn
        1979, the ruins of ancient Thebes were inscribed by UNESCO as a World Cultural
        Heritage site. The two great temples, now called Luxor (Arabic: الأقصر, Al-Uqṣur,
        \"\"The palaces\"\") and al-Karnak (الكرنك), the Valley of the Kings and the
        Valley of the Queens are among the great achievements of ancient Egypt.\n\nThe
        site of Thebes is populated at least since the Middle Paleolithic.\n\n\n\nCoordinates:

        Guatemala,14.566667,-90.666667,\"La Antigua Guatemala (commonly referred to
        as just Antigua or La Antigua) is a city in the central highlands of Guatemala
        famous for its well-preserved Spanish Mudéjar-influencedBaroque architecture
        as well as a number of spectacular ruins of colonial churches. It has been
        designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nAntigua Guatemala serves as the
        municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. It also
        serves as the departmental capital of Sacatepéquez Department.\n\nThe city
        had a peak population of some 60,000 in the 1770s; the bulk of the population
        moved away in the late 18th century. Despite significant population growth
        in the late 20th century, the city had only reached half that number by the
        1990s. According to the 2007 census, the city has some 34,685 inhabitants.\n\nLa
        Antigua Guatemala means the \"\"Old Guatemala\"\" and was the third capital
        of Guatemala. The first capital of Guatemala was founded on the site of a
        Kakchikel-Maya city, now called Iximche, on Monday, July 25, 1524—the day
        of Saint James—and therefore named Ciudad de Santiago de los Caballeros de
        Goathemalan (City of Saint James of the Knights of Guatemala). Naturally,
        St. James became the patron saint of the city.\n\nAfter several Cakchiquel
        uprisings, the capital was moved to a more suitable site in the Valley of
        Alotenango (Rio Guacalate) on November 22, 1527, and kept its original name.
        When this city, on the site of present-day San Miguel Escobar, was destroyed
        on September 11, 1541 by a devastating lahar from the Volcán de Agua, the
        colonial authorities decided to move once more, this time to the Panchoy Valley.
        So, on March 10, 1543 the Spanish conquistadors founded present-day Antigua,
        and again, it was named Santiago de los Caballeros. For more than 200 years
        it served as the seat of the military governor of the Spanish colony of Guatemala,
        a large region that included almost all of present-day Central America and
        the southernmost State of Mexico: Chiapas. In 1566 King Felipe II of Spain
        gave it the title of \"\"Muy Noble y Muy Leal\"\" (\"\"Very Noble and Very
        Loyal\"\").\n\nOn September 29, 1717, an estimated 7.4 magnitude earthquake
        hit Antigua Guatemala, and destroyed over 3,000 buildings. Much of the city's
        architecture was ruined. The damage the earthquake did to the city made authorities
        consider moving the capital to another city.\n\nIn 1773, the Santa Marta earthquakes
        destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location for
        the city. The Spanish Crown ordered (1776) the removal of the capital to a
        safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where Guatemala City, the modern
        capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name
        and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción (New Guatemala of the Ascension)
        and its patron saint is Our Lady of Ascension. The badly damaged city of Santiago
        de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was
        thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).\n\nCentral
        Park (Parque Central) is the heart of the city. The reconstructed fountain
        there is a popular gathering spot. Off to the side of the Central Park, the
        Arco de Santa Catalina is among the many notable architectural landmarks of
        La Antigua.\n\nLa Antigua is noted for its very elaborate religious celebrations
        during Lent (Cuaresma), leading up to Holy Week (Semana Santa) and Easter
        (Pascua). Each Sunday in Lent, one of the local parishes sponsor a Procession
        through the streets of Antigua. Elaborate and beautiful artistic carpets predominantly
        made of dyed sawdust, flowers and even fruits and vegetables adorn the processions'
        path.\n\nDue to its popularity amongst tourists and its very well developed
        tourism infrastructure, Antigua Guatemala is often used as a central location
        in which many choose to set up base and from here, visit other tourist areas
        in Guatemala and Central America. Cruise ships that dock at Guatemalan ports
        offer trips to Antigua from both the Pacific and Atlantic.\n\nAntigua also
        holds a sizeable retirement community from the US as well as Europe as its
        colonial charm has appealed to many who have crossed paths with this enchanting
        and romantic town.\n\nTourism is the main driver of the economy. Antigua is
        also a coffee producing region of Anacafé.\n\nAntigua is known as a destination
        for people who want to learn Spanish through immersion. There are many Spanish
        language schools in Antigua and it is one of the most popular and best recognized
        centers for Spanish language study by students from Europe and North America.
        Language institutes are one of the primary industries of Antigua, along with
        tourism.\n\nThe University of San Carlos in Antigua was founded by the Papal
        Bull of Pope Innocent XI issued dated 18 June 1687.\n\nAntigua GFC football
        club has played in the Guatemala top division for several years but have been
        playing in the second division lately. Their home stadium is the Estadio Pensativo
        which has a capacity of 9,000. They are nicknamed Los panzas verdes (\"\"Green
        bellies\"\").\n\n\n\nA number of restaurants can be found in Antigua. Many
        small eateries can be found at the Antigua marketplace located next to the
        central bus stop, next to the main market. U.S. style fast food restaurants
        including \"\"Burger King\"\", \"\"McDonald's\"\", as well as Guatemalan favorite
        \"\"Pollo Campero\"\" are in the city.\n\nAntigua is a growing tourist destination
        in Guatemala as it is close to Guatemala City but is much calmer and safer,
        with more tourist oriented activities. It is possible to take buses from Antigua
        to many parts of Guatemala, many travel agencies offer shuttles to the main
        touristic places: Monterrico beach, Atitlan Lake, Coban, Tikal or even Copan
        in Honduras, though the transportation is more central in Guatemala City.\n\nThree
        large volcanoes dominate the horizon around Antigua.\n\nThe most commanding,
        to the south of the city, is the Volcán de Agua or \"\"Volcano of Water\"\",
        some 3766 meters (12,356 ft) high. When the Spanish arrived, the inhabitants
        of the zone, Kakchikel Mayas, called it Hunapú (and they still do). However,
        it became known as Volcán de Agua after a mudslide from the volcano buried
        the second site of the capital, which prompted the Spanish authorities to
        move the capital to present-day Antigua. The original site of the 2nd capital
        is now the village San Miguel Escobar.\n\nTo the west of the city are a pair
        of peaks, Acatenango, last erupted in 1972, some 3976 meters (13045 ft) high,
        and the Volcán de Fuego or \"\"Volcano of Fire\"\", some 3763 meters (12346 ft)
        high. \"\"Fuego\"\" is famous for being almost constantly active at a low
        level. Smoke issues from its top daily, but larger eruptions are rare.\n\nCoordinates:

        Area and the Patriarchal Basilica of Aquileia,45.768333,13.3675,\"Aquileia
        (Friulian: Acuilee/Aquilee/Aquilea) is an ancient Roman city in what is now
        Italy, at the head of the Adriatic at the edge of the lagoons, about 10 km
        from the sea, on the river Natiso (modern Natisone), the course of which has
        changed somewhat since Roman times. Today, it is one of the main archeological
        sites of Northern Italy.\n\nAquileia was founded as a colony by the Romans
        in 180/181 BC along the Natissa River, on land south of the Julian Alps but
        about 8 miles north of the lagoons. Apparently named from an indigenous word
        Akylis, the colony served as a frontier fortress at the north-east corner
        of transpadane Italy and was intended to protect the Veneti, faithful Roman
        allies, during the Illyrian Wars and act as a buttress to check the advance
        of other warlike people, such as the hostile tribes of Carni and Histri. In
        fact, Aquileia was founded on a site not far from where Gaulish invaders had
        attempted to settle in 183 BC.\n\nThe colony was established with Latin rights
        by the triumvirate of Publius Scipio Nasica, Caius Flaminius, and Lucius Manlius
        Acidinus, two of whom were of consular and one of praetorian rank. They led
        3,000 pedites (infantry), mainly from Samnium, who with their families formed
        the bulk of the settlers and were soon supplemented by native Veneti. It is
        likely that Aquileia had been a center of Venetia even before the coming of
        the Romans. And Aquileia's strategic military position also served to promote
        the Venetic trade in amber imported from the Baltic.\n\nAquileia was connected
        by road with Bologna probably in 173 BC; and subsequently with Genoa in 148
        BC by the Via Postumia, which ran through Cremona, Bedriacum and Altinum,
        joining the first-mentioned road at Concordia, while the construction of the
        Via Popilia from Rimini to Ad Portum near Altinum in 132 BC improved the communications
        still further.\n\nIn 169 BC, 1,500 more Latin colonists with their families
        were settled in the town as a reinforcement to the garrison. The discovery
        of the gold fields near the modern Klagenfurt in 130 BC brought it into notice,
        and it soon became a place of importance, not only owing to its strategic
        position, but as a centre of trade, especially in agricultural products and
        viticulture. It also had, in later times at least, considerable brickfields.\n\nThe
        original Latin colony became a municipium probably in 90 BC. Citizens were
        ascribed to the Roman tribe Velina. The customs boundary of Italy was close
        by in Cicero's day. It was plundered by the Iapydes under Augustus, but, in
        the period of peace which followed, was able to develop its resources. Augustus
        visited it during the Pannonian wars in 12‑10 BC and it was the birthplace
        of Tiberius' son by Julia, in the latter year.\n\nIt was the starting-point
        of several important roads leading to the north-eastern portion of the empire
        — the road (Via Iulia Augusta) by Iulium Carnicum to Veldidena (mod. Wilten,
        near Innsbruck), from which branched off the road into Noricum, leading by
        Virunum (Klagenfurt) to Laurieum (Lorch) on the Danube, the road into Pannonia,
        leading to Aemona (Ljubljana) and Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica), the road to
        Tarsatica (near Fiume, now Rijeka) and Siscia (Sisak), and that to Tergeste
        (Trieste) and the Istrian coast.\n\nBesides natives of Italy, Celts, Illyrians,
        Greeks, Egyptians, Jews, and Syrians all settled in the city and contributed
        to its commercial development. Jewish artisans established a flourishing trade
        in glasswork. Metal from Noricum was forged and exported. The ancient Venetic
        trade in amber from the Baltic was continued. Wine, especially its famous
        Pucinum was exported. Oil was imported from Proconsular Africa.\n\nIn terms
        of religion, the Roman pantheon was adopted although a native sungod, Belenus,
        had a large following. Jews practiced their ancestral religion and it was
        perhaps some of these Jews who became the first Christians. Meanwhile, soldiers
        brought the martial cult of Mithras.\n\nIn the war against the Marcomanni
        in 167, the town was hard pressed; its fortifications had fallen into disrepair
        during the long peace. Nevertheless, when in 168 Marcus Aurelius made Aquileia
        the principal fortress of the empire against the barbarians of the North and
        East, it rose to the pinnacle of its greatness and soon had a population of
        100,000. In 238, when the town took the side of the Senate against the Emperor
        Maximinus Thrax, the fortifications were hastily restored, and proved of sufficient
        strength to resist for several months, until Maximinus himself was assassinated.\n\nDuring
        the 4th century, Aquileia maintained its importance. Constantine sojourned
        there on numerous occasions. It became a naval station and the seat of the
        Corrector Venetiarum et Histriae; a mint was established, of which the coins
        were very numerous, and the bishop obtained the rank of metropolitan archbishop.
        A council held in the city in 381 was only the first of a series of Councils
        of Aquileia that have been convened over the centuries.\n\nAn imperial palace
        was constructed here, in which the emperors after the time of Diocletian frequently
        resided; and the city often played a part in the struggles between the rulers
        of the 4th century. In 340, Emperor Constantine II was killed under its walls
        while attempting to take the city from his younger brother Constans.\n\nAt
        the end of the 4th century, Ausonius, enumerated Aquileia as the ninth among
        the great cities of the world, placing Rome, Mediolanum and Capua before it.
        However, it was besieged by Alaric and the Visigoths in 401, during which
        time some of its residents fled to the lagoons, and again unsuccessfully in
        408. In 452, the city was so utterly destroyed by Attila's Huns that it was
        afterwards hard to recognize its original site. The Roman inhabitants, together
        with those of smaller towns in the neighborhood, fled to the lagoons, and
        so laid the foundations of the cities of Venice and nearby Grado.\n\nYet Aquileia
        would rise again, though much diminished, and continue to exist until the
        Lombard invasion of 568. It was once more destroyed (590) by the Lombards.
        Meanwhile, the patriarch fled to the island town of Grado, which was under
        the protection of the Byzantines. When the patriarch residing in Grado was
        reconciled with Rome in 606, those continuing in their rejection of the Second
        Council of Constantinople elected a patriarch at Aquileia. Thus, the diocese
        was essentially divided into two parts, with the mainland patriarchate of
        Aquileia under the protection of the Lombards, and the insular patriarchate
        of Aquileia seated in Grado being protected by the exarchate of Ravenna and
        later the Doges of Venice, with the collusion of the Lombards. The line of
        the patriarchs elected in Aquileia would continue in schism until 699. However,
        although they kept the title of patriarch of Aquileia, they moved their residence
        first to Cormons and later to Cividale.\n\nThe Lombard Dukes of Friuli ruled
        Aquileia and the surrounding mainland territory from Cividale. In 774, Charlemagne
        conquered the Lombard duchy and made it into a Frankish one with Eric of Friuli
        as duke. In 787, Charlemagne named the priest and master of grammar at the
        Palace School Paulinus the new patriarch of Aquileia. Although Paulinus resided
        mainly at Cividale, his successor Maxentius considered rebuilding Aquileia.
        However, the project never came to fruition.\n\nWhile Maxentius was patriarch,
        the pope approved the Synod of Mantua, which affirmed the precedence of the
        mainland patriarch of Aquileia over the patriarch of Grado. However, material
        conditions were soon to worsen for Aquileia. The ruins of Aquileia were continually
        pillaged for building material. And with the collapse of the Carolingians
        in the 10th century, the inhabitants would suffer under the raids of the Magyars.\n\nBy
        the 11th century, the patriarch of Aquileia had grown strong enough to assert
        temporal sovereignty over Friuli and Aquileia. The Holy Roman Emperor gave
        the region to the patriarch as a feudal possession. However, the patriarch's
        temporal authority was constantly disputed and assailed by the territorial
        nobility.\n\nIn 1027 and 1044 Patriarch Poppo of Aquileia, who rebuilt the
        cathedral of Aquileia, entered and sacked neighboring Grado, and, though the
        Pope reconfirmed the Patriarch of the latter in his dignities, the town never
        fully recovered, though it continued to be the seat of the Patriarchate until
        its formal transference to Venice in 1450.\n\nIn the 14th century the Patriarchate
        reached its biggest extension, stretching from the Piave river to the Julian
        Alps and northern Istria. The seat of the Patriarchate of Aquileia had been
        transferred to Udine in 1238, but returned to Aquiliea in 1420 when Venice
        annexed the territory of Udine.\n\nIn 1445, the defeated patriarch Ludovico
        Trevisan acquiesced in the loss of his ancient temporal estate in return for
        an annual salary of 5,000 ducats allowed him from the Venetian treasury. Henceforth
        only Venetians were allowed to hold the title of Patriarch of Aquileia. The
        Patriarchate was incorporated in the Republic of Venice with the name of Patria
        del Friuli, ruled by a General Proveditor or a \"\"Luogotenente\"\" living
        in Udine.\n\nIt was finally officially suppressed in 1751, and the sees of
        Udine and Gorizia (Görz) established in its stead.\n\nThe Cathedral of Aquileia
        is a flat-roofed basilica erected by Patriarch Poppo in 1031 on the site of
        an earlier church, and rebuilt about 1379 in the Gothic style by Patriarch
        Marquard von Randeck.\n\nThe façade, in Romanesque-Gothic style, is connected
        by a portico to the Church of the Pagans, and the remains of the 5th century
        Baptistry. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with a noteworthy mosaic
        pavement from the 4th century. The wooden ceiling is from 1526, while the
        fresco decoration belongs to various ages: from the 4th century in the St.
        Peter's chapel of the apse area; from the 11th century in the apse itself;
        from the 12th century in the so-called \"\"Crypt of the Frescoes\"\", under
        the presbytery, with a cycle depicting the origins of Christianity in Aquileia
        and the history of St. Hermagoras, first bishop of the city.\n\nNext to the
        11th century Romanesque chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, at the beginning of
        the left aisle, flooring of different ages can be seen: the lowest is from
        a Roman villa of the age of Augustus; the middle one has a typical cocciopesto
        pavemente; the upper one, bearing blackening from the Attila's fire, has geometrical
        decorations.\n\nExternally, behind the 9th century campanile and the apse,
        is the Cemetery of the Fallen, where ten unnamed soldiers of World War I are
        buried. Saint Hermangoras is also buried there.\n\nThe ancient buildings of
        Aquileia served as stone quarries for centuries, and no edifices of the Roman
        period remain above ground. Excavations have revealed one street and the north-west
        angle of the town walls, while the National Archaeological Museum (one of
        the most important museums of Ancient Rome in the world) contains over 2,000
        inscriptions, statues and other antiquities, as well as glasses of local production
        and a numismatics collection.\n\nThe site of Aquileia, believed to be the
        largest Roman city yet to be excavated, is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage
        List.\n\nIn the Monastero fraction is a 5th century Christian basilica, later
        a Benedictine monastery, which today houses the Paleo-Christian Museum.\",\"Province

        (Iran, Syria and Jordan) is a water management system used to provide a reliable
        supply of water to human settlements and for irrigation in hot, arid and semi-arid
        climates. Qanats are also called kārīz (or kārēz from Persian: كاريز) (Iran,
        Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia, derived from Persian: كاهریز), kahan
        (from Persian: کهن), khettara (Morocco); galeria (Spain); falaj (United Arab
        Emirates and Oman); Kahn (Baloch) or foggara/fughara (North Africa). Alternative
        terms for qanats in Asia and North Africa are kakuriz, chin-avulz, and mayun.
        Common variants of qanat in English include kanat, khanat, kunut, kona, konait,
        ghanat, ghundat.\\n\\nThe qanat technology is known to have developed in pre-Islamic
        Iran[when?] and then spread to other cultures. However, a recently discovered
        falaj system in al-Ain, UAE, dates to 1000 BC, and another in Umm Safah, Sharja,
        dates to the Iron Age. Also, a qanat-like system called the Turpan water system
        originated in China during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 24 CE).\\n\\nThe value
        of a qanat is directly related to the quality, volume and regularity of the
        water flow. Much of the population of Iran and other arid countries in Asia
        and North Africa historically depended upon the water from qanats; the areas
        of population corresponded closely to the areas where qanats are possible.
        Although a qanat was expensive to construct, its long-term value to the community,
        and therefore to the group who invested in building and maintaining it, was
        substantial.\\n\\nQanats are constructed as a series of well-like vertical
        shafts, connected by gently sloping tunnels. Qanats tap into subterranean
        water in a manner that efficiently delivers large quantities of water to the
        surface without need for pumping. The water drains relying on gravity, with
        the destination lower than the source, which is typically an upland aquifer.
        Qanats allow water to be transported over long distances in hot dry climates
        without losing a large proportion of the water to seepage and evaporation.\\n\\nIt
        is very common in the construction of a qanat for the water source to be found
        below ground at the foot of a range of foothills of mountains, where the water
        table is closest to the surface. From this point, the slope of the qanat is
        maintained closer to level than the surface above, until the water finally
        flows out of the qanat above ground. To reach an aquifer, qanats must often
        extend for long distances.\\n\\nQanats are sometimes split into an underground
        distribution network of smaller canals called kariz. Like qanats, these smaller
        canals were below ground to avoid contamination. In some cases water from
        a qanat is stored in a reservoir, typically storing night flow for daytime
        use. An Ab Anbar is an example of a traditional qanat fed reservoir for drinking
        water in Persian antiquity.\\n\\nThe qanat system has the advantage of being
        resistant to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, and to deliberate
        destruction in war. Furthermore, it is almost insensitive to the levels of
        precipitation, delivering a flow with only gradual variations from wet to
        dry years.\\n\\nThe qanat technology is used most extensively in areas with
        the following characteristics:[citation needed]\\n\\nA typical town or city
        in Iran and elsewhere where the qanat is used has more than one qanat. Fields
        and gardens are located both over the qanats a short distance before they
        emerge from the ground and after the surface outlet. Water from the qanats
        defines both the social regions in the city and the layout of the city.\\n\\nThe
        water is freshest, cleanest, and coolest in the upper reaches and more prosperous
        people live at the outlet or immediately upstream of the outlet. When the
        qanat is still below grade, the water is drawn to the surface via water wells
        or animal driven Persian wells. Private subterranean reservoirs could supply
        houses and buildings for domestic use and garden irrigation as well. Further,
        air flow from the qanat is used to cool an underground summer room (shabestan)
        found in many older houses and buildings.\\n\\nDownstream of the outlet, the
        water runs through surface canals called jubs (jūbs) which run downhill, with
        lateral branches to carry water to the neighborhood, gardens and fields. The
        streets normally parallel the jubs and their lateral branches. As a result,
        the cities and towns are oriented consistent with the gradient of the land;
        this is a practical response to efficient water distribution over varying
        terrain.\\n\\nThe lower reaches of the canals are less desirable for both
        residences and agriculture. The water grows progressively more polluted as
        it passes downstream. In dry years the lower reaches are the most likely to
        see substantial reductions in flow.\\n\\nTraditionally qanats are built by
        a group of skilled laborers, muqannīs, with hand labor. The profession historically
        paid well and was typically handed down from father to son.\\n\\nThe critical,
        initial step in qanat construction is identification of an appropriate water
        source. The search begins at the point where the alluvial fan meets the mountains
        or foothills; water is more abundant in the mountains because of orographic
        lifting and excavation in the alluvial fan is relatively easy. The muqannīs
        follow the track of the main water courses coming from the mountains or foothills
        to identify evidence of subsurface water such as deep-rooted vegetation or
        seasonal seeps. A trial well is then dug to determine the location of the
        water table and determine whether a sufficient flow is available to justify
        construction. If these prerequisites are met, then the route is laid out aboveground.\\n\\nEquipment
        must be assembled. The equipment is straightforward: containers (usually leather
        bags), ropes, reels to raise the container to the surface at the shaft head,
        hatchets and shovels for excavation, lights, spirit levels or plumb bobs and
        string. Depending upon the soil type, qanat liners (usually fired clay hoops)
        may also be required.\\n\\nAlthough the construction methods are simple, the
        construction of a qanat requires a detailed understanding of subterranean
        geology and a degree of engineering sophistication. The gradient of the qanat
        must be carefully controlled—too shallow a gradient yields no flow—too steep
        a gradient will result in excessive erosion, collapsing the qanat. And misreading
        the soil conditions leads to collapses which at best require extensive rework
        and, at worst, can be fatal for the crew.\\n\\nConstruction of a qanat is
        usually performed by a crew of 3-4 muqannīs. For a shallow qanat, one worker
        typically digs the horizontal shaft, one raises the excavated earth from the
        shaft and one distributes the excavated earth at the top.\\n\\nThe crew typically
        begins from the destination to which the water will be delivered into the
        soil and works toward the source (the test well). Vertical shafts are excavated
        along the route, separated at a distance of 20–35 m. The separation of the
        shafts is a balance between the amount of work required to excavate them and
        the amount of effort required to excavate the space between them, as well
        as the ultimate maintenance effort. In general, the shallower the qanat, the
        closer the vertical shafts. If the qanat is long, excavation may begin from
        both ends at once. Tributary channels are sometimes also constructed to supplement
        the water flow.\\n\\nMost qanats in Iran run less than 5 km, while some have
        been measured at ~70 km in length near Kerman. The vertical shafts usually
        range from 20 to 200 meters in depth, although qanats in the province of Khorasan
        have been recorded with vertical shafts of up to 275 m. The vertical shafts
        support construction and maintenance of the underground channel as well as
        air interchange. Deep shafts require intermediate platforms to simplify the
        process of removing spoils.\\n\\nThe construction speed depends on the depth
        and nature of the ground. If the earth is easy/soft to work; at 20 meters
        depth, a crew of 4 people can excavate a horizontal length of 40 meters per
        day. When the vertical shaft reaches 40 meters, they can only excavate 20
        meters horizontally per day and at 60 meters in depth this drops below 5 horizontal
        meters per day. In Algeria, a common speed is just 2m per day at 15m depth.
        Deep, long qanats (which many are) require years and even decades to construct.\\n\\nThe
        excavated material is usually transported by means of leather bags up the
        vertical shafts. It is mounded around the vertical shaft exit, providing a
        barrier that prevents windblown or rain driven debris from entering the shafts.
        These mounds may be covered to provide further protection to the qanat. From
        the air, these shafts look like a string of bomb craters.\\n\\nThe qanat's
        water-carrying channel must have a sufficient downward slope that water flows
        easily. However the downward gradient must not be so great as to create conditions
        under which the water transitions between supercritical and subcritical flow;
        if this occurs, the waves which are established can result in severe erosion
        that can damage or destroy the qanat. In shorter qanats the downward gradient
        varies between 1:1000 and 1:1500, while in longer qanats it may be almost
        horizontal. Such precision is routinely obtained with a spirit level and string.\\n\\nIn
        cases where the gradient is steeper, underground waterfalls may be constructed
        with appropriate design features (usually linings) to absorb the energy with
        minimal erosion. In some cases the water power has been harnessed to drive
        underground mills. If it is not possible to bring the outlet of the qanat
        out near the settlement, it is necessary to run a jub or canal overground.
        This is avoided when possible to limit pollution, warming and water loss due
        to evaporation.\\n\\nThe vertical shafts may be covered to minimize in-blown
        sand. The channels of qanats must be periodically inspected for erosion or
        cave-ins, cleaned of sand and mud and otherwise repaired. Air flow must be
        assured before entry for safety.\\n\\nSome damaged qanats have been restored.
        In order to be sustainable, restoration needs to take into account many non-technical
        factors, beginning with the process of selecting the qanat to be restored.
        In the case of Syria, three sites were chosen based on a national inventory
        conducted in 2001. One of them, the Drasiah qanat of Dmeir, was completed
        in 2002. Selection criteria included the availability of a steady groundwater
        flow, social cohesion and willingness to contribute of the community using
        the qanat, and the existence of a functioning water rights system.\\n\\nThe
        primary applications of qanats are for irrigation, providing cattle with water
        and drinking water supply. Other applications include cooling and ice storage.\\n\\nQanats
        used in conjunction with a wind tower can provide cooling as well as a water
        supply. A wind tower is a chimney-like structure positioned above the house;
        of its four openings, the one opposite the wind direction is opened to move
        air out of the house. Incoming air is pulled from a qanat below the house.
        The air flow across the vertical shaft opening creates a lower pressure (see
        Bernoulli effect) and draws cool air up from the qanat tunnel, mixing with
        it. The air from the qanat was drawn into the tunnel at some distance away
        and is cooled both by contact with the cool tunnel walls/water and by the
        giving up latent heat of evaporation as water evaporates into the air stream.
        In dry desert climates this can result in a greater than 15°C reduction in
        the air temperature coming from the qanat; the mixed air still feels dry,
        so the basement is cool and only comfortably moist (not damp). Wind tower
        and qanat cooling have been used in desert climates for over 1000 years.\\n\\nIn
        400 BC Persian engineers had already mastered the technique of storing ice
        in the middle of summer in the desert.\\n\\nThe ice could be brought in during
        the winters from nearby mountains. But in a more usual & sophisticated method
        they had a wall made along east-west direction close to the Ice Pit (yakhchal).In
        winter the qanat water was being canalized to north side of the wall. The
        shadow of the wall makes water freeze more quickly so they could have more
        ice per each winter day. Then ice was being stored in a specially designed,
        naturally cooled refrigerators called yakhchal (meaning ice pits). A large
        underground space with thick insulated walls was connected to a qanat, and
        a system of windcatchers or Wind Towers was used to draw cool subterranean
        air up from the qanat to maintain temperatures inside the space at low levels,
        even during hot summer days. As a result, the ice melted slowly and ice was
        available year-round.\\n\\nThe Qanats, called Kariz (rhymes with \\\"breeze\\\")
        \ in Pashto and Dari, have also been in use for hundreds of years. Kariz structures
        are especially found in the Southern Afghanistan provinces of Kandahar, Uruzgan,
        Nimroz and Hilmand. The incessant war for the last 30 years has destroyed
        a number of these ancient structures. In the troubled times maintenance was
        not always possible. To add to the troubles, at present (2008) the cost of
        labour has become very high and maintaining the Kariz structures is no longer
        possible[dubious – discuss]. Lack of skilled artisans who have the traditional
        knowledge also poses difficulties. A number of the large farmers are abandoning
        their Kariz which has been in their families sometimes for centuries, and
        moving to tube and dug wells backed by diesel pumps[citation needed].\\n\\nHowever
        the government of Afghanistan is aware of the importance of these structures
        and all efforts are being made to repair, reconstruct and maintain (through
        the community) the kariz[citation needed]. The Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation
        and Development along with National and International NGOs is making the effort.\\n\\nStill,
        there are functional qanat systems in 2009. American forces are reported to
        have unintentionally destroyed some of the channels during expansion of a
        military base, creating tensions between them and the local community. Some
        of these tunnels have been used to store supplies, and to move men and equipment
        underground.\\n\\nAn oasis at Turpan in the deserts of northwestern China
        uses water provided by qanat (locally karez). Turfan has long been the center
        of a fertile oasis and an important trade center along the Silk Road's northern
        route, at which time it was adjacent to the kingdoms of Korla and Karashahr
        to the southwest. The historical record of the karez system extends back to
        the Han Dynasty. The Turfan Water Museum (see photos on this page) is a Protected
        Area of the People's Republic of China because of the importance of the local
        karez system to the history of the area. The number of karez systems in the
        area is slightly below 1,000 and the total length of the canals is about 5,000
        kilometers.\\n\\nIn Karnataka, India, a Qanat-type structure called Suranga
        is used to tap underground water. But these are rarely in use these days[citation
        needed].\\n\\nIt has been suggested that alleged underground temples at Gua
        Made in Java reached by shafts, in which masks of a green metal were found,
        originated as a qanat.\\n\\nIn the middle of the twentieth century, it is
        estimated that approximately 50,000 qanats were in use in Iran, each commissioned
        and maintained by local users. Of these only 25,000 remain in use as of 1980.\\n\\nThe
        oldest and largest known qanat is in the Iranian city of Gonabad which after
        2700 years still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000
        people. Its main well depth is more than 360 meters and its length is 45 kilometers.
        Yazd, Khorasan and Kerman are the known zones for their dependence with an
        extensive system of qanats.\\n\\nIn traditional Persian architecture, a Kariz
        (کاریز) is a small Qanat, usually within a network inside an urban setting.
        Kariz is what distributes the Qanat into its final destinations.\\n\\nA survey
        of Qanat systems in the Kurdistan region of Iraq conducted by the Department
        of Geography at Oklahoma State University (USA) on behalf of UNESCO in 2009
        found that out of 683 karez systems, some 380 were still active in 2004, but
        only 116 in 2009. Reasons for the decline of qanats include \\\"abandonment
        and neglect\\\" previous to 2004, \\\"excessive pumping from wells\\\" and,
        since 2005, drought. Water shortages are said to have forced over 100,000
        people who depended on karez systems for their livelihoods to leave their
        homes since 2005. The study says that a single karez has the potential to
        provide enough household water for nearly 9,000 individuals and irrigate over
        200 hectares of farmland. UNESCO and the government of Iraq plan to rehabilitate
        Karez through a Karez Initiative for Community Revitalization to be launched
        in 2010. Most of the karez are in Sulaymaniyah Governorate (84%). A large
        number are also found in Erbil Governorate (13%), especially on the broad
        plain around and in Erbil city.\\n\\nAmong the qanats built in the Roman Empire
        was possibly the longest continuous qanat ever built, the 94 km long Gadara
        Aqueduct in northern Jordan. Partly following the course of an older Hellenistic
        aqueduct, excavation work arguably started after a visit of emperor Hadrian
        in 129-130 AD. The Gadara Aqueduct was never quite finished, and was put in
        service only in sections.\\n\\nThe Chagai district is in the north west corner
        of Balochistan, Pakistan, bordering with Afghanistan and Iran. Qanats, locally
        known as karezes, are found more broadly in this region. They are spread from
        Chaghai district all the way up to Zhob district. A number of them are present
        in Qilla Abdullah and Pishin districts. Karezes are also extensively found
        in the neighbouring areas of Afghanistan such as Kandahar. The remains of
        karezes found in different parts of the district are attributed to the Arabs.\\n\\nQanats
        were found over much of Syria. The widespread installation of groundwater
        pumps has lowered the water table and qanat system. Qanats have gone dry and
        been abandoned across the country.\\n\\nIn Oman from the Iron Age Period (found
        in Salut, Bat and other sites) a system of underground aqueducts called Falaj
        were constructed, a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by gently
        sloping horizontal tunnels. There are three types of Falaj Daudi (داوودية)with
        underground aqueducts Ghaili (الغيلية ) requiring a dam to collect the water
        Aini (العينية ) whose source is a water spring These enabled large scale agriculture
        to flourish in a dry land environment According to UNESCO some 3,000 aflaj
        (plural) or falaj (singular), are still in use in Oman today. Nizwa, the former
        capital city of Oman, was built around a falaj which is in use to this day.
        These systems date to before the Iron Age in Oman . In July 2006, five representative
        examples of this irrigation system were inscribed as a World Heritage Site.\\n\\nThe
        oasis of Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates continues traditional falaj (qanat)
        irrigations for the palm-groves and gardens.\\n\\nThere are 4 main oases in
        the Egyptian desert. The Kharga Oasis is one of them which has been extensively
        studied. As early as the second half of the 5th century BC there is evidence
        that water was being used via qanats. The qanat is excavated through water-bearing
        sandstone rock which seeps into the channel to collect in a basin behind a
        small dam at the end. The width is approximately 60 cm, but the height ranges
        from 5 to 9 meters; it is likely that the qanat was deepened to enhance seepage
        when the water table dropped (as is also seen in Iran). From there the water
        was used to irrigate fields.\\n\\nThere is another instructive structure located
        at the Kharga Oasis. A well which apparently dried up was improved by driving
        a side shaft through the easily penetrated sandstone (presumably in the direction
        of greatest water seepage) into the hill of Ayn-Manâwîr to allow collection
        of additional water. After this side shaft had been extended, another vertical
        shaft was driven to intersect the side shaft. Side chambers were built and
        holes bored into the rock—presumably at points where water seeped from the
        rocks—are evident.\\n\\nDavid Mattingley reports foggara extending for hundreds
        of miles in the Garamantes area near Jarma in Libya: \\\"The channels were
        generally very narrow - less than 2 feet wide and 5 high - but some were several
        miles long, and in total some 600 foggara extended for hundreds of miles underground.
        The channels were dug out and maintained using a series of regularly-spaced
        vertical shafts, one every 30 feet or so, 100,000 in total, averaging 30 feet
        in depth, but sometimes reaching 130.\\\" (\\\"The 153 Club Newsletter\\\",
        July 2007 No. 112, pp. 14–19; reprinted from Current world Archaeology.\\n\\nThe
        foggara water management system in Tunisia, used to create oases, is similar
        to that of the Iranian qanat. The foggara is dug into the foothills of a fairly
        steep mountain range such as the eastern ranges of the Atlas mountains. Rainfall
        in the mountains enters the aquifer and moves toward the Saharan region to
        the south. The foggara, 1 to 3 km in length, penetrates the aquifer and collects
        water. Families maintain the foggara and own the land it irrigates over a
        ten meter wide, with width only by the size of plot that the available water
        will irrigate.\\n\\nQanats (designated foggaras in Algeria) are the source
        of water for irrigation at large oases like that at Gourara. The foggaras
        are also found at Touat (an area of Adrar 200 km from Gourara). The length
        of the foggaras in this region is estimated to be thousands of kilometers.\\n\\nAlthough
        sources suggest that the foggaras may have been in use as early as 200 AD,
        they were clearly in use by the 11th century after the Arabs took possession
        of the oases in the 10th century and the residents embraced Islam.\\n\\nThe
        water is metered to the various users through the use of distribution weirs
        which meter flow to the various canals, each for a separate user.\\n\\nThe
        humidity of the oases is also used to supplement the water supply to the foggara.
        The temperature gradient in the vertical shafts causes air to rise by natural
        convection, causing a draft to enter the foggara. The moist air of the agricultural
        area is drawn into the foggara in the opposite direction to the water run-off.
        In the foggara it condenses on the tunnel walls and the air passed out of
        the vertical shafts. This condensed moisture is available for reuse.\\n\\nIn
        southern Morocco the qanat (locally khettara) is also used. On the margins
        of the Sahara Desert, the isolated oases of the Draa River valley and Tafilalt
        have relied on qanat water for irrigation since the late-14th century. In
        Marrakech and the Haouz plain the qanats have been abandoned since the early
        1970s as they've dried; in the Tafilaft area half of the 400 khettaras are
        still in use. The Hassan Adahkil Dam's impact on local water tables is said
        to be one of the many reasons given for the loss of half of the khettara.\\n\\nThe
        black berbers (haratin) of the south were the hereditary class of qanat diggers
        in Morocco who build and repair these systems. Their work was hazardous.\\n\\nQanats
        have preserved in Armenia in the community of Shvanidzor, in the southern
        province of Syunik, bordering with Iran. Qanats are named kahrezes in Armenian.
        There are 5 kahrezes in Shvanidzor. Four of them were constructed in XII-XIVc,
        even before the village was founded. The fifth kahrez was constructed in 2005.
        Potable water runs through I, II and V kahrezs. Kahrez III and IV are in quite
        poor condition. In summer, especially in July and August, the amount of water
        reaches its minimum, creating critical situation in the water supply system.
        Still, kahrezes are the main source of potable and irrigation water for the
        community.\\n\\nThe 5653 m long Claudius Tunnel, meant for draining the largest
        Italian inland water, Fucine Lake, was constructed using the qanat technique.
        It featured shafts up to 122 m deep. The entire ancient town of Palermo in
        Sicily was equipped with a huge qanat system built during the Arab period
        (827–1072). Many of the qanat are now mapped and some can be visited. The
        famous Scirocco room has an air-conditioning system cooled by the flow of
        water in a qanat and a \\\"wind tower\\\", a structure able to catch the wind
        and direct it into the room.\\n\\nThe Raschpëtzer near Helmsange in southern
        Luxembourg is a particularly well preserved example of a Roman qanat. It is
        probably the most extensive system of its kind north of the Alps. To date
        some 330 m of the total tunnel length of 600 m have been explored. Thirteen
        of the 20 to 25 shafts have been investigated. The qanat appears to have provided
        water for a large Roman villa on the slopes of the Alzette valley. It was
        built during the Gallo-Roman period, probably around the year 150 and functioned
        for about 120 years thereafter.\\n\\nThere are still many examples of galeria
        or qanat systems in Spain, most likely brought to the area by the Moors during
        their occupation of the Iberian peninsula. Turrillas in Andalusia on the north
        facing slopes of the Sierra de Alhamilla has evidence of a qanat system. Granada
        is another site with an extensive qanat system.\\n\\nQanats in the Americas,
        usually referred to as filtration galleries, can be found in the Nazca region
        of Peru and in northern Chile. The Spanish introduced qanats into Mexico in
        1520 AD.\",\"longitude\":\"57.536056\",\"latitude\":\"22.998889\",\"title\":\"Aflaj

        Amiens (French: Cathédrale Notre-Dame d'Amiens), or simply Amiens Cathedral,
        is a Roman Catholic cathedral and seat of the Bishop of Amiens, Jean-Luc Bouilleret.
        The cathedral is the tallest complete cathedral in France, with the greatest
        interior volume (estimated at 200,000 m³). The vaults of the nave are 42.30 m
        high, the tallest nave vaults in any completed French cathedral, and surpassed
        only by the incomplete Beauvais Cathedral. This monumental cathedral is located
        in Amiens, the chief city of Picardy, in the Somme River valley a little over
        100 kilometers north of Paris.\\n\\nNotre-Dame d'Amiens has been listed as
        a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981 and was profiled in a PBS documentary.\\n\\nThe
        lack of documentation concerning the construction of the Gothic cathedral
        may be in part the result of fires that destroyed the chapter archives in
        1218 and again in 1258—a fire that damaged the cathedral itself. Bishop Evrard
        de Fouilly initiated work on the cathedral in 1220. Robert de Luzarches was
        the architect until 1228, and was followed by Thomas de Cormont until 1258.
        His son, Renaud de Cormont, acted as the architect until 1288. The chronicle
        of Corbie gives a completion date for the cathedral of 1266. Finishing works
        continued, however. Its floors are covered with a number of designs, such
        as the swastika (to symbolize Jesus' triumph over death). The labyrinth was
        installed in 1288. The cathedral contains the alleged head of John the Baptist,
        a relic brought from Constantinople by Wallon de Sarton as he was returning
        from the Fourth Crusade.\\n\\nThe construction of the cathedral at this period
        can be seen as resulting from a coming together of necessity and opportunity.
        The destruction of earlier buildings and attempts at rebuilding by fire forced
        the fairly rapid construction of a building that, consequently, has a good
        deal of artistic unity. The long and relatively peaceful reign of Louis IX
        of France brought a prosperity to the region, based on thriving agriculture
        and a booming cloth trade, that made the investment possible. The great cathedrals
        of Reims and Chartres are roughly contemporary.\\n\\nThe original design of
        the flying buttresses around the choir had them placed too high to counteract
        the force of the ceiling arch pushing outwards resulting in excessive lateral
        forces being placed on the vertical columns. The structure was only saved
        when, centuries later, masons placed a second row of more robust flying buttresses
        that connected lower down on the outer wall. This fix failed to counteract
        similar issues with the lower wall which began to develop large cracks around
        the late Middle Ages. This was solved by another patch that consisted of a
        wrought iron bar chain being installed around the mezzanine level to resist
        the forces pushing the stone columns outward. The chain was installed red
        hot to act as a cinch, tightening as it cooled.\\n\\nThe west front of the
        cathedral, (illustration, right) built in a single campaign, 1220–36, shows
        an unusual degree of artistic unity: its lower tier with three vast deep porches
        is capped with the gallery of twenty-two over lifesize kings, which stretches
        across the entire façade beneath the rose window. Above the rose window there
        is an open arcade, the galerie des sonneurs. Flanking the nave, the two towers
        were built without close regard to the former design, the south tower being
        finished in 1366, the north one, reaching higher, in 1406.\\n\\nThe Western
        portals of the cathedral are justly famous for their elaborate sculpture,
        featuring a gallery of locally-important saints and large eschatological scenes.
        Statues of saints in the portal of the cathedral have been identified as including
        the locally venerated Saints Victoricus and Gentian, Saint Domitius, Saint
        Ulphia, and Saint Fermin.\\n\\nIn the book Mr Standfast, John Buchan has his
        character Richard Hannay describe the cathedral as being \\\"the noblest church
        that the hand of man ever built only for God.\\\"\\n\\nDuring the process
        of laser cleaning in the 1990s, it was discovered that the western façade
        of the cathedral was originally painted in multiple colours. A technique was
        perfected to determine the exact make-up of the colours as they were applied
        in the 13th century. Then, in conjunction with the laboratories of EDF (Electricity
        of France) and the expertise of the Society Skertzo, elaborate lighting techniques
        were developed to project these colours directly on the façade with precision,
        recreating the polychromatic appearance of the 13th century. When projected
        on the statues around the portals, the result is a stunning display that brings
        the figures to life. The projected colors are faint to photograph, but a good
        quality DSLR will provide excellent results as shown here.\\n\\nOf course,
        the full magical effect can best be appreciated by direct viewing, accompanied
        by stirring music, which can be done at the Son et lumière on Summer evenings,
        during the Christmas Fair, and over the New Year.\\n\\nAmiens cathedral contains
        the largest medieval interior in Western Europe, supported by 126 pillars.
        Both the nave and the chancel are vast but extremely light, with considerable
        amounts of stained glass surviving, despite the depredations of war.\\n\\nThe
        ambulatory surrounding the choir is richly decorated with polychrome sculpture
        and flanked by numerous chapels. One of the most sumptuous is the Drapers'
        chapel. The cloth industry was the most dynamic component of the medieval
        economy, especially in northern France, and the cloth merchants were keen
        to display their wealth and civic pride. Another striking chapel is dedicated
        to St Thomas of Canterbury, a 13th century dedication that complements the
        cathedral's own very full list of martyrs.\\n\\nThe interior contains works
        of art and decoration from every period since the building of the cathedral.\\n\\nThe
        initial impetus for the building of the cathedral came from the installation
        of the reputed head of John the Baptist on 17 December 1206. The head was
        part of the loot of the Fourth Crusade, which had been diverted from campaigning
        against the Turks to sacking the great Christian city of Constantinople. A
        sumptuous reliquary was made to house the skull. Although later lost, a 19th
        century replica still provides a focus for prayer and meditation in the North
        aisle.\\n\\nSome of the most important works of art are sequences of polychrome
        sculpture, dating mainly from the late 15th and the 16th centuries. A large
        sequence in the North transept illustrates Jesus' Cleansing of the Temple,
        with imaginative tableaux of the Temple. Both sides of the ambulatory are
        lined with sequences illustrating the lives of the two saints whose cults
        brought large numbers of pilgrims to the cathedral: John the Baptist and St
        Firmin, the first bishop of Amiens. The artists took care to create a parallelism
        in the telling of the stories: both saints, decapitated for offending the
        rich and powerful, suffer neglect and loss, until a later generation discovers
        their relics and houses them fittingly.\\n\\nThe baroque pulpit, constructed
        of marble and gilded wood, dominates the nave of the cathedral. It is supported
        by three allegorical female figures, apparently representing Faith, Hope and
        Charity, the three Theological Virtues.\\n\\n\\n\\nCoordinates: 49°53′42″N

        Bozra, Busra Eski Şam, Busra ash-Sham, Nova Trajana Bostra) is an ancient
        city administratively belonging to the Daraa Governorate in southern Syria.
        It is a major archaeological site and has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage
        Site.\\n\\nThe settlement was first mentioned in the documents of Tutmose
        III and Akhenaton (14th century BC). Bosra was the first Nabatean city in
        the 2nd century BC. The Nabatean Kingdom was conquered by Cornelius Palma,
        a general of Trajan, in 106.\\n\\nUnder the Roman Empire, Bosra was renamed
        Nova Trajana Bostra, and was the residence of the legio III Cyrenaica and
        capital of the Roman province Arabia Petraea. The city flourished and became
        a major metropolis at the juncture of several trade routes, including the
        Roman road to the Red Sea. The two Councils of Arabia were held at Bostra
        in 246 and 247 AD. The city was conquered by the Sassanid Persians in the
        early 7th century, and, after a short Byzantine reconquest, was finally captured
        by the forces of the Rashidun Caliphate under Khalid ibn Walid in the Battle
        of Bosra (634). Thereafter it was an Islamic possession.\\n\\nBosra played
        an important part in the early life of the Prophet of Islam, Mohammed as described
        in the entry for the Christian Monk, Bahira. Bahira was witnessing to Muhammad
        in the prophethood.\\n\\nToday, Bosra is a major archaeological site, containing
        ruins from Roman, Byzantine, and Muslim times, its main feature being the
        well preserved Roman theatre. Every year there is a national music festival
        hosted in the main theater.\\n\\nOf the city which once counted 80,000 inhabitants,
        there remains today only a village settled among the ruins. The second century
        Roman theater, constructed probably under Trajan, is the only monument of
        this type with its upper gallery in the form of a covered portico which has
        been integrally preserved. It was fortified between 481 and 1231 AD.\\n\\nFurther,
        Nabatean and Roman monuments, Christian churches, mosques and Madrasahs are
        present within the half ruined enceinte of the city. The structure of this
        monument a central plan with eastern apses flanked by 2 sacristies exerted
        a decisive influence on the evolution of Christian architectural forms, and,
        to a certain extent, on Islamic style as well. Al-Omari Mosque of Bosra is
        one of the oldest surviving mosques in Islamic history.\\n\\nClose by are
        the Kharaba Bridge and the Gemarrin Bridge, both Roman bridges.\\n\\nCoordinates:

        also transcribed as Nessebar or Nesebur; ancient name: Mesembria) is an ancient
        town and one of the major seaside resorts on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast,
        located in Burgas Province. It is the administrative centre of the homonymous
        Nesebar Municipality. Often referred to as the \\\"Pearl of the Black Sea\\\"
        and \\\"Bulgaria's Dubrovnik\\\", Nesebar is a rich city-museum defined by
        more than three millennia of ever-changing history.\\n\\nIt is a one of the
        most prominent tourist destinations and seaports on the Black Sea, in what
        has become a popular area with several large resorts—the largest, Sunny Beach,
        is situated immediately to the north of Nesebar.\\n\\nNesebar has on several
        occasions found itself on the frontier of a threatened empire, and as such
        it is a town with a rich history. The ancient part of the town is situated
        on a peninsula (previously an island) connected to the mainland by a narrow
        man-made isthmus, and it bears evidence of occupation by a variety of different
        civilisations over the course of its existence. Its abundance of historic
        buildings prompted UNESCO to include Nesebar in its list of World Heritage
        Sites in 1983.\\n\\nAs of December 2009, the town has a population of 11,626
        inhabitants. It lies at 42°39′N 27°44′E\uFEFF / \uFEFF42.65°N 27.733°E\uFEFF

        / 42.65; 27.733.\\n\\nInhabited in the Antiquity by the Thracians and the
        Ancient Greeks, the original Thracian settlement Menebria was called Mesembria
        (Ancient Greek: Μεσήμβρια) by the Ancient Greeks. Under this name it was still
        known in the Middle Ages to Bulgarians and Byzantines.\\n\\nOriginally a Thracian
        settlement known as Menebria, the town became a Greek colony when settled
        by Dorians from Megara at the beginning of the 6th century BC, and was an
        important trading centre from then on and a rival of Apollonia (Sozopol).
        It remained the only Doric colony along the Black Sea coast, as the rest were
        typical Ionic colonies. Remains from the Hellenistic period include the acropolis,
        a temple of Apollo, and an agora. A wall which formed part of the fortifications
        can still be seen on the north side of the peninsula. Bronze and silver coins
        were minted in the city since the 5th century BC and gold coins since the
        3rd century BC.\\n\\nThe town fell under Roman rule in 71 BC, yet continued
        to enjoy privileges such as the right to mint its own coinage. It was one
        of the most important strongholds of the Byzantine Empire from the 5th century
        AD onwards, and was fought over by Byzantines and Bulgarians, being captured
        and incorporated in the lands of the First Bulgarian Empire in 812 by Khan
        Krum after a two week siege only to be ceded back to Byzantium by Knyaz Boris
        I in 864 and reconquered by his son Tsar Simeon the Great. During the time
        of the Second Bulgarian Empire it was also contested by Bulgarian and Byzantine
        forces and enjoyed particular prosperity under Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander
        (1331–1371) until it was conquered by Crusaders led by Amadeus VI, Count of
        Savoy in 1366. The Bulgarian version of the name, Nesebar or Mesebar, has
        been attested since the 11th century.\\n\\nMonuments from the Middle Ages
        include the 5–6th century Stara Mitropoliya (\\\"old bishopric\\\"; also St
        Sophia), a basilica without a transept; the 10th century church of the Virgin;
        and the 11th century Nova Mitropoliya (\\\"new bishopric\\\"; also St Stephen)
        which continued to be embellished until the 18th century. In the 13th and
        14th century a remarkable series of churches were built: St Theodore, St Paraskeva,
        St Michael St Gabriel, and St John Aliturgetos.\\n\\nThe capture of the town
        by the Turks in 1453 marked the start of its decline, but its architectural
        heritage remained and was enriched in the 19th century by the construction
        of wooden houses in style typical for the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast during
        this period. It was a kaza centre in İslimye sanjak of Edirne Province before
        1878. After the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in 1878, Nesebar
        became part of the autonomous Ottoman province of Eastern Rumelia as a kaza
        centre in Burgaz sanjak until it united with the Principality of Bulgaria
        in 1886.\\n\\nAround the end of the 19th century Nesebar was a small town
        of Greek fishermen and vinegrowers, but developed as a key Bulgarian seaside
        resort since the beginning of the 20th century. After 1925 a new town part
        was built and the historic Old Town was restored.\\n\\nNesebar is sometimes
        said to be the town with the highest number of churches per capita.[1], [2]
        Although this might be wrong, their number and variety is still impressive.
        Some of the most famous include:\\n\\nWhether built during the Byzantine,
        Bulgarian or Ottoman rule of the city, the churches of Nesebar represent the
        rich architectural heritage of the Eastern Orthodox world and illustrate the
        gradual development from Early Christian basilicas to medieval cross-domed
        churches.\\n\\nNesebar Gap on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands,

        the Greek name for a city in Ancient Egypt located about 800 km south of the
        Mediterranean, on the east bank of the river Nile. The Theban Necropolis is
        located nearby on the west bank of the Nile. Thebes was inhabited from around
        3200 BC. It was the eponymous capital of Waset, the fourth Upper Egyptian
        nome. Waset was the capital of Egypt during part of the 11th Dynasty (Middle
        Kingdom) and most of the 18th Dynasty (New Kingdom), when Hatshepsut built
        a Red Sea fleet to facilitate trade between Thebes Red Sea port of Elim, modern
        Quasir, and Elat at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. Traders bought frankincense,
        myrrh, bitumen, natron, fine woven linen, juniper oil and copper amulets for
        the mortuary industry at Karnak with Nubian gold. With the 19th Dynasty the
        seat of government moved to the Delta. The archaeological remains of Thebes
        offer a striking testimony to Egyptian civilization at its height. The Greek
        poet Homer extolled the wealth of Thebes in the Iliad, Book 9 (c. 8th Century
        BC): \\\"... in Egyptian Thebes the heaps of precious ingots gleam, the hundred-gated
        Thebes.\\\"\\n\\nThe name Thebai is the Greek designation of the ancient Egyptian
        opet \\\"The Karnak Temple\\\" (from coptic ta-pe, Ta-opet became Thebai).
        At the seat of the Theban triad of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu, Thebes was known
        in the Egyptian language from the end of the New Kingdom as niwt-imn, \\\"The
        City of Amun.\\\" This found its way into the Hebrew Bible as נא אמון nōʼ
        ʼāmôn (Nahum 3:8),\\\"no\\\" in Hebrew meaning city with \\\"no amon\\\" or
        \\\"City of Amon\\\" referring to the Egyptian deity Amon-Ra, most likely
        it is also the same as נא (\\\"No\\\") (Ezekiel 30:14). In Greek this name
        was rendered Διόσπολις Diospolis, \\\"City of Zeus\\\", as Zeus was the god
        whom the Greeks identified with Amun, see interpretatio graeca. The Greeks
        surnamed the city μεγάλη megale, \\\"the Great\\\", to differentiate it from
        numerous other cities called Diospolis. The Romans rendered the name Diospolis
        Magna.\\n\\nIn modern usage, the mortuary temples and tombs on the west bank
        of the river Nile are generally thought of as part of Thebes.\\n\\nIn 1979,
        the ruins of ancient Thebes were inscribed by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage
        site. The two great temples, now called Luxor (Arabic: الأقصر, Al-Uqṣur, \\\"The
        palaces\\\") and al-Karnak (الكرنك), the Valley of the Kings and the Valley
        of the Queens are among the great achievements of ancient Egypt.\\n\\nThe

        (commonly referred to as just Antigua or La Antigua) is a city in the central
        highlands of Guatemala famous for its well-preserved Spanish Mudéjar-influencedBaroque
        architecture as well as a number of spectacular ruins of colonial churches.
        It has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\n\\nAntigua Guatemala
        serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same
        name. It also serves as the departmental capital of Sacatepéquez Department.\\n\\nThe
        city had a peak population of some 60,000 in the 1770s; the bulk of the population
        moved away in the late 18th century. Despite significant population growth
        in the late 20th century, the city had only reached half that number by the
        1990s. According to the 2007 census, the city has some 34,685 inhabitants.\\n\\nLa
        Antigua Guatemala means the \\\"Old Guatemala\\\" and was the third capital
        of Guatemala. The first capital of Guatemala was founded on the site of a
        Kakchikel-Maya city, now called Iximche, on Monday, July 25, 1524—the day
        of Saint James—and therefore named Ciudad de Santiago de los Caballeros de
        Goathemalan (City of Saint James of the Knights of Guatemala). Naturally,
        St. James became the patron saint of the city.\\n\\nAfter several Cakchiquel
        uprisings, the capital was moved to a more suitable site in the Valley of
        Alotenango (Rio Guacalate) on November 22, 1527, and kept its original name.
        When this city, on the site of present-day San Miguel Escobar, was destroyed
        on September 11, 1541 by a devastating lahar from the Volcán de Agua, the
        colonial authorities decided to move once more, this time to the Panchoy Valley.
        So, on March 10, 1543 the Spanish conquistadors founded present-day Antigua,
        and again, it was named Santiago de los Caballeros. For more than 200 years
        it served as the seat of the military governor of the Spanish colony of Guatemala,
        a large region that included almost all of present-day Central America and
        the southernmost State of Mexico: Chiapas. In 1566 King Felipe II of Spain
        gave it the title of \\\"Muy Noble y Muy Leal\\\" (\\\"Very Noble and Very
        Loyal\\\").\\n\\nOn September 29, 1717, an estimated 7.4 magnitude earthquake
        hit Antigua Guatemala, and destroyed over 3,000 buildings. Much of the city's
        architecture was ruined. The damage the earthquake did to the city made authorities
        consider moving the capital to another city.\\n\\nIn 1773, the Santa Marta
        earthquakes destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location
        for the city. The Spanish Crown ordered (1776) the removal of the capital
        to a safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where Guatemala City, the modern
        capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name
        and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción (New Guatemala of the Ascension)
        and its patron saint is Our Lady of Ascension. The badly damaged city of Santiago
        de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was
        thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).\\n\\nCentral
        Park (Parque Central) is the heart of the city. The reconstructed fountain
        there is a popular gathering spot. Off to the side of the Central Park, the
        Arco de Santa Catalina is among the many notable architectural landmarks of
        La Antigua.\\n\\nLa Antigua is noted for its very elaborate religious celebrations
        during Lent (Cuaresma), leading up to Holy Week (Semana Santa) and Easter
        (Pascua). Each Sunday in Lent, one of the local parishes sponsor a Procession
        through the streets of Antigua. Elaborate and beautiful artistic carpets predominantly
        made of dyed sawdust, flowers and even fruits and vegetables adorn the processions'
        path.\\n\\nDue to its popularity amongst tourists and its very well developed
        tourism infrastructure, Antigua Guatemala is often used as a central location
        in which many choose to set up base and from here, visit other tourist areas
        in Guatemala and Central America. Cruise ships that dock at Guatemalan ports
        offer trips to Antigua from both the Pacific and Atlantic.\\n\\nAntigua also
        holds a sizeable retirement community from the US as well as Europe as its
        colonial charm has appealed to many who have crossed paths with this enchanting
        and romantic town.\\n\\nTourism is the main driver of the economy. Antigua
        is also a coffee producing region of Anacafé.\\n\\nAntigua is known as a destination
        for people who want to learn Spanish through immersion. There are many Spanish
        language schools in Antigua and it is one of the most popular and best recognized
        centers for Spanish language study by students from Europe and North America.
        Language institutes are one of the primary industries of Antigua, along with
        tourism.\\n\\nThe University of San Carlos in Antigua was founded by the Papal
        Bull of Pope Innocent XI issued dated 18 June 1687.\\n\\nAntigua GFC football
        club has played in the Guatemala top division for several years but have been
        playing in the second division lately. Their home stadium is the Estadio Pensativo
        which has a capacity of 9,000. They are nicknamed Los panzas verdes (\\\"Green
        bellies\\\").\\n\\n\\n\\nA number of restaurants can be found in Antigua.
        Many small eateries can be found at the Antigua marketplace located next to
        the central bus stop, next to the main market. U.S. style fast food restaurants
        including \\\"Burger King\\\", \\\"McDonald's\\\", as well as Guatemalan favorite
        \\\"Pollo Campero\\\" are in the city.\\n\\nAntigua is a growing tourist destination
        in Guatemala as it is close to Guatemala City but is much calmer and safer,
        with more tourist oriented activities. It is possible to take buses from Antigua
        to many parts of Guatemala, many travel agencies offer shuttles to the main
        touristic places: Monterrico beach, Atitlan Lake, Coban, Tikal or even Copan
        in Honduras, though the transportation is more central in Guatemala City.\\n\\nThree
        large volcanoes dominate the horizon around Antigua.\\n\\nThe most commanding,
        to the south of the city, is the Volcán de Agua or \\\"Volcano of Water\\\",
        some 3766 meters (12,356 ft) high. When the Spanish arrived, the inhabitants
        of the zone, Kakchikel Mayas, called it Hunapú (and they still do). However,
        it became known as Volcán de Agua after a mudslide from the volcano buried
        the second site of the capital, which prompted the Spanish authorities to
        move the capital to present-day Antigua. The original site of the 2nd capital
        is now the village San Miguel Escobar.\\n\\nTo the west of the city are a
        pair of peaks, Acatenango, last erupted in 1972, some 3976 meters (13045 ft)
        high, and the Volcán de Fuego or \\\"Volcano of Fire\\\", some 3763 meters
        (12346 ft) high. \\\"Fuego\\\" is famous for being almost constantly active
        at a low level. Smoke issues from its top daily, but larger eruptions are
        rare.\\n\\nCoordinates: 14°34′N 90°44′W\uFEFF / \uFEFF14.567°N 90.733°W\uFEFF

        of Udine, Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region\",\"description\":\"Aquileia (Friulian:
        Acuilee/Aquilee/Aquilea) is an ancient Roman city in what is now Italy, at
        the head of the Adriatic at the edge of the lagoons, about 10 km from the
        sea, on the river Natiso (modern Natisone), the course of which has changed
        somewhat since Roman times. Today, it is one of the main archeological sites
        of Northern Italy.\\n\\nAquileia was founded as a colony by the Romans in
        180/181 BC along the Natissa River, on land south of the Julian Alps but about
        8 miles north of the lagoons. Apparently named from an indigenous word Akylis,
        the colony served as a frontier fortress at the north-east corner of transpadane
        Italy and was intended to protect the Veneti, faithful Roman allies, during
        the Illyrian Wars and act as a buttress to check the advance of other warlike
        people, such as the hostile tribes of Carni and Histri. In fact, Aquileia
        was founded on a site not far from where Gaulish invaders had attempted to
        settle in 183 BC.\\n\\nThe colony was established with Latin rights by the
        triumvirate of Publius Scipio Nasica, Caius Flaminius, and Lucius Manlius
        Acidinus, two of whom were of consular and one of praetorian rank. They led
        3,000 pedites (infantry), mainly from Samnium, who with their families formed
        the bulk of the settlers and were soon supplemented by native Veneti. It is
        likely that Aquileia had been a center of Venetia even before the coming of
        the Romans. And Aquileia's strategic military position also served to promote
        the Venetic trade in amber imported from the Baltic.\\n\\nAquileia was connected
        by road with Bologna probably in 173 BC; and subsequently with Genoa in 148
        BC by the Via Postumia, which ran through Cremona, Bedriacum and Altinum,
        joining the first-mentioned road at Concordia, while the construction of the
        Via Popilia from Rimini to Ad Portum near Altinum in 132 BC improved the communications
        still further.\\n\\nIn 169 BC, 1,500 more Latin colonists with their families
        were settled in the town as a reinforcement to the garrison. The discovery
        of the gold fields near the modern Klagenfurt in 130 BC brought it into notice,
        and it soon became a place of importance, not only owing to its strategic
        position, but as a centre of trade, especially in agricultural products and
        viticulture. It also had, in later times at least, considerable brickfields.\\n\\nThe
        original Latin colony became a municipium probably in 90 BC. Citizens were
        ascribed to the Roman tribe Velina. The customs boundary of Italy was close
        by in Cicero's day. It was plundered by the Iapydes under Augustus, but, in
        the period of peace which followed, was able to develop its resources. Augustus
        visited it during the Pannonian wars in 12‑10 BC and it was the birthplace
        of Tiberius' son by Julia, in the latter year.\\n\\nIt was the starting-point
        of several important roads leading to the north-eastern portion of the empire
        — the road (Via Iulia Augusta) by Iulium Carnicum to Veldidena (mod. Wilten,
        near Innsbruck), from which branched off the road into Noricum, leading by
        Virunum (Klagenfurt) to Laurieum (Lorch) on the Danube, the road into Pannonia,
        leading to Aemona (Ljubljana) and Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica), the road to
        Tarsatica (near Fiume, now Rijeka) and Siscia (Sisak), and that to Tergeste
        (Trieste) and the Istrian coast.\\n\\nBesides natives of Italy, Celts, Illyrians,
        Greeks, Egyptians, Jews, and Syrians all settled in the city and contributed
        to its commercial development. Jewish artisans established a flourishing trade
        in glasswork. Metal from Noricum was forged and exported. The ancient Venetic
        trade in amber from the Baltic was continued. Wine, especially its famous
        Pucinum was exported. Oil was imported from Proconsular Africa.\\n\\nIn terms
        of religion, the Roman pantheon was adopted although a native sungod, Belenus,
        had a large following. Jews practiced their ancestral religion and it was
        perhaps some of these Jews who became the first Christians. Meanwhile, soldiers
        brought the martial cult of Mithras.\\n\\nIn the war against the Marcomanni
        in 167, the town was hard pressed; its fortifications had fallen into disrepair
        during the long peace. Nevertheless, when in 168 Marcus Aurelius made Aquileia
        the principal fortress of the empire against the barbarians of the North and
        East, it rose to the pinnacle of its greatness and soon had a population of
        100,000. In 238, when the town took the side of the Senate against the Emperor
        Maximinus Thrax, the fortifications were hastily restored, and proved of sufficient
        strength to resist for several months, until Maximinus himself was assassinated.\\n\\nDuring
        the 4th century, Aquileia maintained its importance. Constantine sojourned
        there on numerous occasions. It became a naval station and the seat of the
        Corrector Venetiarum et Histriae; a mint was established, of which the coins
        were very numerous, and the bishop obtained the rank of metropolitan archbishop.
        A council held in the city in 381 was only the first of a series of Councils
        of Aquileia that have been convened over the centuries.\\n\\nAn imperial palace
        was constructed here, in which the emperors after the time of Diocletian frequently
        resided; and the city often played a part in the struggles between the rulers
        of the 4th century. In 340, Emperor Constantine II was killed under its walls
        while attempting to take the city from his younger brother Constans.\\n\\nAt
        the end of the 4th century, Ausonius, enumerated Aquileia as the ninth among
        the great cities of the world, placing Rome, Mediolanum and Capua before it.
        However, it was besieged by Alaric and the Visigoths in 401, during which
        time some of its residents fled to the lagoons, and again unsuccessfully in
        408. In 452, the city was so utterly destroyed by Attila's Huns that it was
        afterwards hard to recognize its original site. The Roman inhabitants, together
        with those of smaller towns in the neighborhood, fled to the lagoons, and
        so laid the foundations of the cities of Venice and nearby Grado.\\n\\nYet
        Aquileia would rise again, though much diminished, and continue to exist until
        the Lombard invasion of 568. It was once more destroyed (590) by the Lombards.
        Meanwhile, the patriarch fled to the island town of Grado, which was under
        the protection of the Byzantines. When the patriarch residing in Grado was
        reconciled with Rome in 606, those continuing in their rejection of the Second
        Council of Constantinople elected a patriarch at Aquileia. Thus, the diocese
        was essentially divided into two parts, with the mainland patriarchate of
        Aquileia under the protection of the Lombards, and the insular patriarchate
        of Aquileia seated in Grado being protected by the exarchate of Ravenna and
        later the Doges of Venice, with the collusion of the Lombards. The line of
        the patriarchs elected in Aquileia would continue in schism until 699. However,
        although they kept the title of patriarch of Aquileia, they moved their residence
        first to Cormons and later to Cividale.\\n\\nThe Lombard Dukes of Friuli ruled
        Aquileia and the surrounding mainland territory from Cividale. In 774, Charlemagne
        conquered the Lombard duchy and made it into a Frankish one with Eric of Friuli
        as duke. In 787, Charlemagne named the priest and master of grammar at the
        Palace School Paulinus the new patriarch of Aquileia. Although Paulinus resided
        mainly at Cividale, his successor Maxentius considered rebuilding Aquileia.
        However, the project never came to fruition.\\n\\nWhile Maxentius was patriarch,
        the pope approved the Synod of Mantua, which affirmed the precedence of the
        mainland patriarch of Aquileia over the patriarch of Grado. However, material
        conditions were soon to worsen for Aquileia. The ruins of Aquileia were continually
        pillaged for building material. And with the collapse of the Carolingians
        in the 10th century, the inhabitants would suffer under the raids of the Magyars.\\n\\nBy
        the 11th century, the patriarch of Aquileia had grown strong enough to assert
        temporal sovereignty over Friuli and Aquileia. The Holy Roman Emperor gave
        the region to the patriarch as a feudal possession. However, the patriarch's
        temporal authority was constantly disputed and assailed by the territorial
        nobility.\\n\\nIn 1027 and 1044 Patriarch Poppo of Aquileia, who rebuilt the
        cathedral of Aquileia, entered and sacked neighboring Grado, and, though the
        Pope reconfirmed the Patriarch of the latter in his dignities, the town never
        fully recovered, though it continued to be the seat of the Patriarchate until
        its formal transference to Venice in 1450.\\n\\nIn the 14th century the Patriarchate
        reached its biggest extension, stretching from the Piave river to the Julian
        Alps and northern Istria. The seat of the Patriarchate of Aquileia had been
        transferred to Udine in 1238, but returned to Aquiliea in 1420 when Venice
        annexed the territory of Udine.\\n\\nIn 1445, the defeated patriarch Ludovico
        Trevisan acquiesced in the loss of his ancient temporal estate in return for
        an annual salary of 5,000 ducats allowed him from the Venetian treasury. Henceforth
        only Venetians were allowed to hold the title of Patriarch of Aquileia. The
        Patriarchate was incorporated in the Republic of Venice with the name of Patria
        del Friuli, ruled by a General Proveditor or a \\\"Luogotenente\\\" living
        in Udine.\\n\\nIt was finally officially suppressed in 1751, and the sees
        of Udine and Gorizia (Görz) established in its stead.\\n\\nThe Cathedral of
        Aquileia is a flat-roofed basilica erected by Patriarch Poppo in 1031 on the
        site of an earlier church, and rebuilt about 1379 in the Gothic style by Patriarch
        Marquard von Randeck.\\n\\nThe façade, in Romanesque-Gothic style, is connected
        by a portico to the Church of the Pagans, and the remains of the 5th century
        Baptistry. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with a noteworthy mosaic
        pavement from the 4th century. The wooden ceiling is from 1526, while the
        fresco decoration belongs to various ages: from the 4th century in the St.
        Peter's chapel of the apse area; from the 11th century in the apse itself;
        from the 12th century in the so-called \\\"Crypt of the Frescoes\\\", under
        the presbytery, with a cycle depicting the origins of Christianity in Aquileia
        and the history of St. Hermagoras, first bishop of the city.\\n\\nNext to
        the 11th century Romanesque chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, at the beginning
        of the left aisle, flooring of different ages can be seen: the lowest is from
        a Roman villa of the age of Augustus; the middle one has a typical cocciopesto
        pavemente; the upper one, bearing blackening from the Attila's fire, has geometrical
        decorations.\\n\\nExternally, behind the 9th century campanile and the apse,
        is the Cemetery of the Fallen, where ten unnamed soldiers of World War I are
        buried. Saint Hermangoras is also buried there.\\n\\nThe ancient buildings
        of Aquileia served as stone quarries for centuries, and no edifices of the
        Roman period remain above ground. Excavations have revealed one street and
        the north-west angle of the town walls, while the National Archaeological
        Museum (one of the most important museums of Ancient Rome in the world) contains
        over 2,000 inscriptions, statues and other antiquities, as well as glasses
        of local production and a numismatics collection.\\n\\nThe site of Aquileia,
        believed to be the largest Roman city yet to be excavated, is inscribed on
        the UNESCO World Heritage List.\\n\\nIn the Monastero fraction is a 5th century
        Christian basilica, later a Benedictine monastery, which today houses the
        Paleo-Christian Museum.\",\"longitude\":\"13.3675\",\"latitude\":\"45.768333\",\"title\":\"Archaeological
